<p>In this transcription a black dotted underline indicates a hyperlink
to a page, illustration or footnote; hyperlinks are also marked by aqua
highlighting when the mouse pointer hovers over them. A red dashed
underline indicates the presence of a concealed comment which, in the
html version, can be revealed by hovering the mouse pointer over the
<ins title="Transcriber’s note: Comment">underlined</ins> text. Page
numbers are shown in the right margin. Footnotes are located at the end
of the book.</p>

<p>The text contains typographic characters that will not necessarily
display correctly with all viewing devices. If some of the characters
look abnormal, first ensure that the device’s character encoding is
set to Unicode (UTF-8). The default font might also need to be changed
to a Unicode font such as Arial Unicode MS, DejaVu, Segoe UI Symbol or
FreeSerif.</p>

<p>Many of the illustrations in the book were of poor quality and a
few had no visible useful information. Where possible, they have been
enhanced to clarify the details. Alphabetic labels in the illustrations
occasionally differ from those stated in the accompanying captions.
Some illustrations have been relocated closer to the relevant text and
the list of illustrations has been amended as necessary.</p>

<p>Discrepancies between the Table of Contents and headings in the body of
the text are as in the original. Inconsistencies in the use of single
and double quotation marks are as in the original; other punctuation
anomalies have been corrected silently. Missing degree (°) symbols have
been inserted where necessary.</p>

<p>Minor spelling inconsistencies are as in the original, e.g.
tetanising/tetanizing, Das/Dass, but the following overt spelling
errors have been corrected silently:</p>

<h3>I.&mdash;THE PROBLEM OF MOVEMENT IN PLANTS</h3>

<p class="tac mt1em"><i>By</i></p>

<p class="tac mtb1em"><span class="smcap">Prof. Sir J.&nbsp;C. Bose</span>.</p>


<p>The phenomenon of movement in plants under the action
of external stimuli presents innumerable difficulties and
complications. The responding organs are very different:
they may be the pulvini of the ‘sensitive’ or those of
the less excitable leguminous plants; the petioles of leaves,
which often act as pulvinoids; and organs of plants in a
state of active growth.</p>

<p>Taking first the case of the pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i>, we find
that it responds to mechanical stimulation, to constant
electric current, to induction shock, to the action of
chemical agents, to light, and to warmth as differentiated
from thermal radiation. The reactions induced by these
agents may be similar or dissimilar. An identical agent,
again, may give rise to movements which are not merely
different, but sometimes even of diametrically opposite
characters. Certain organs, for example, direct themselves
towards light, others away from it. Some plants close
their leaflets on the approach of darkness, in the so-called
position of ‘sleep’; apparently similar ‘sleep’ movement
is induced in others by the action of the midday sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="2"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a></span></p>

<p>In <i>Mimosa</i>, the responsive movement is brought about
by a sudden diminution of turgor in the pulvinus. But
very little is definitely known about the responsive reaction
in growing organs. Thus in a tendril, one-sided contraction
causes a shortening of the concave side and a
sudden increase of growth on the convex. No explanation
of this difference has hitherto been forthcoming.
Under the action of light of different intensities a growing
organ may approach the source of light, or place itself at
right angles or move away from it. Again under the
identical stimulus of gravity, the root moves downwards,
and the shoot upwards. The sign of response in different
organs thus changes, apparently without any reason. It
is thus seen, that there is hardly any responsive movement
that has been observed of which an example directly to
the contrary may not be found. For this reason it has
appeared hopeless to unify these very diverse phenomena,
and there has been a tendency towards a belief that it
was not any definite physio­logic­al reaction, but the individuality
of the plant that determines the choice of its
movement.</p>

<p>The complexities which baffle us may, however, arise
from the combination of factors whose individual reactions
are unknown to us. I shall show, for example, how the
movement of a pulvinus under a given stimulus is determined
by the point of application, direct stimulus producing
one effect, and indirect the diametrically opposite.
The normal reaction is again modified by the tonic condition
of the plant. There is again the likelihood of
the presence of other modifying factors. It is clear how
very different the results would become by the permutation
and combination of these diverse factors.</p>

<p>For a comprehensive study of the phenomenon of
plant movement, it is therefore necessary to investigate<span class="pagenum" title="3"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></span>
in detail the effect of a given stimulus under definite
changes of the environmental condition. With regard to a
given stimulus we have to determine the effects of intensity,
of duration, and of the point of application. The in­ves­ti­ga­tion
has to include the effects exhibited not merely by
the pulvinated but also by growing organs. As a result
of such a comprehensive study, it may perhaps be possible
to discover some fundamental reaction operative in bringing
about the responsive movement in all plant organs.</p>

<p>I shall in the course of the following series of Papers,
describe the different apparatus by which the movement
of pulvinated organ and its time-relations are automatically
recorded. In a growing organ the induced movement under
stimulus is brought about by the change in its rate of
growth. That the change is solely due to the particular
stimulus can only be assured by strict maintenance of constancy
of external conditions, during the period of experiment;
this constancy can, in practice, be secured only for
a short time. The necessity for shortening the period of
experiment also arises from a different consideration; for
numerous and varied are the stimulating and mechanical
interactions between neighbouring organs. These effects,
however, come into play after a certain lapse of time.
They may be eliminated by reduction of the period of
experiment.</p>

<p>In order to shorten the period of experiment for the
study of growth movements, the rate of growth has to be
very highly magnified, so as to determine the absolute rate
and its variations in the course of a minute or so. I shall
in a subsequent Paper give full account of an apparatus
I have been able to devise, by which it is possible to
record automatically the rate of growth magnified many
thousand times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="4"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></span></p>

<p>I stated that anomalies of plant movements would disappear,
if we succeeded in carrying out in detail in­ves­ti­ga­tions
of effects of the different individual factors in operation.
In illustration of this I shall, in the first Paper of
the series, give an account of the mysterious movement of
the ‘Praying’ Palm of Faridpur, and describe the in­ves­ti­ga­tions
by which the problem found its solution.</p>

<p>Perhaps no phenomenon is so remarkable and shrouded
with greater mystery as the performances of a particular
Date Palm near Faridpur in Bengal. In the evening, while
the temple bells ring calling upon people to prayer, this
tree bows down as if to prostrate itself. It erects its head
again in the morning, and this process is repeated every
day of the year. This extraordinary phenomenon has been
regarded as miraculous, and pilgrims have been attracted
in large numbers. It is alleged that offerings made to the
tree have been the means of effecting marvellous cures. It
is not necessary to pronounce any opinion on the subject;
these cures may be taken as effective as other faith-cures
now prevalent in the West.</p>

<p>This particular Date Palm, <i>Phœnix dactylifera</i>, is a full-grown
rigid tree, its trunk being 5 metres in length and
25&nbsp;cm. in diameter. It must have been displaced by storm
from the vertical and is now at an inclination of about
60° to the vertical. In consequence of the diurnal movement,
the trunk throughout its entire length is erected in
the morning, and depressed in the afternoon. The highest
point of the trunk thus moves up and down through
one metre; the ‘neck,’ above the trunk, is concave to
the sky in the morning; in the afternoon the curvature<span class="pagenum" title="6"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span>
disappears, or is even slightly reversed. The large leaves
which point high up against the sky in the morning are
thus swung round in the afternoon through a vertical<span class="pagenum" title="7"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>
distance of about five metres. To the popular imagination
the tree appears like a living giant, more than twice the
height of a human being, which leans forward in the
evening from its towering height and bends its neck till
the crown of leaves press against the ground in an
apparent attitude of devotion (Fig.&nbsp;1). Two vertical
stakes, each one metre high, give a general idea of the
size of the tree and movements of the different parts of
the trunk.</p>

<p>For an in­ves­ti­ga­tion in elucidation of this phenomenon
it was <span class="nowrap">necessary:&mdash;</span></p>


<p class="pl3hi">1. To obtain an accurate record of the movement of
the tree day and night, and determine the time
of its maximum erection and fall.</p>

was universal.</p>

temperature on the movement.</p>

<h4>THE RECORDING APPARATUS.</h4>

<p>I shall now describe the principle and construction of
my recording apparatus (<a href="#fig02">Fig.&nbsp;2</a>) seen attached to a horizontally
growing stem of <i>Mimosa pudica</i>. When used to trace<span class="pagenum" title="8"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></span>
the movement of the palm tree, a reducing device is employed
to keep the record within the plate. A lever, R′, records
the movement of the attached tree or plant on a moving
plate of smoked glass. The plate is not in contact with the
tip of the recording lever, but separated from it by a distance
of about 3&nbsp;mm. A special oscillating device, actuated<span class="pagenum" title="9"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span>
by clock-work, C, makes the plate move forwards and backwards.
The forward movement brings about a momentary
contact of the recording tip with the smoked plate inscribing
a dot. These single dots are made at intervals of 15
minutes; at the expiration of the hour, however, contact
is made three times in rapid succession, printing a thick
dot. It is thus easy to determine the movement of the tree
at all times of the day and night. A second lever, R, placed
above, gives on the same plate, thermographic record of the
diurnal variation of temperature. For this I use a differential
thermometer, T, made of a compound strip of brass
and steel. Curvature is induced by the differential expansion
of the two pieces of metal. The up or down movement
of the free end of the compound strip is further magnified
by the recording lever. This arrangement was extremely
sensitive and gave accurate record of variation of temperature.
By the forward movement of the oscillating plate
two dots are made at the same time,&mdash;one for the temperature
and the other for the corresponding movement of
the tree. As the two recorders do not move vertically up
or down, but describe a circle, the dots vertically one above
the other may not correspond as regards time. Any possibility
of error in calculation is obviated by the fact that
the thick dots in both the records are made every hour,
and the subsequent thin dots at intervals of 15 minutes.</p>

same clock-work moves plate laterally in 24 hours.</div>
</div>

<p>A difficulty arose at the beginning in obtaining sanction
of the proprietor to attach the recorder to the tree. He
was apprehensive that its miraculous power might disappear
by profane contact with foreign-looking instruments. His
misgivings were removed on the assurance that the instrument
was made in my laboratory in India, and that it
would be attached to the tree by one of my assistants,
who was the son of a priest.</p>

<p>From results of observation it is found that the tree<span class="pagenum" title="10"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>
moves through its entire length; the fall of the highest
point of the trunk is one metre. The movement is not<span class="pagenum" title="11"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>
passive, but an active force is exerted; the force necessary
to counteract this movement is equivalent to the weight of
47 kilograms: in other words, the force is sufficient to lift a
man off the ground. But far greater force would be required
to restrain the change of curvature of the neck of
the hard and rigid tree.</p>

is given in the upper record; the corresponding diurnal curve of movement of
the tree is given in the lower. Successive dots at intervals of 15 minutes;
thick dots at intervals of an hour.</div>
</div>

<p>Before entering into the in­ves­ti­ga­tion of the cause of
periodic movement I shall give a general account of its
characteristics. A casual observation would lead one to
conclude that the tree lifted itself at sunrise and prostrated
at sunset. But continuous record obtained with my recorder
attached to the upper part of the trunk shows that the
tree was never at rest, but in a state of continuous
movement, which underwent periodic reversals (Fig.&nbsp;3).
The tree attained its maximum erection at 7 in the morning,
after which there is a rapid movement of fall. The down
movement reached its maximum at 3-15 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>, after which
it was reversed and the tree erected itself to its greatest
height at 7 next morning. This diurnal periodicity was
maintained day after day.</p>


<h4>UNIVERSALITY OF TREE MOVEMENT.</h4>

<p>The next question which I wished to investigate was
whether the movement of the particular Faridpur tree was
a unique phenomenon. It appeared more likely that similar
movement would, under careful observation, be detected in
all trees. The particular palm tree was growing at a considerable
inclination to the vertical; the movement of the
tree and its leaves became easily noticeable, since the
ground afforded a fixed and striking object of reference. In
a tree growing more or less erect, the movement, if any,<span class="pagenum" title="12"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>
would escape notice, since such movements would be executed
with only the empty space as the background.</p>

<a id="fig04"></a>
<img src="images/fig04.jpg" width="446" height="403" alt="" />
<div>Fig.&nbsp;4. Record of the Sijbaria Palm from noon for 24 hours. Successive dots,
at intervals of 15 minutes.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Experiment 1.</i>&mdash;Believing the phenomenon to be universal
I experimented with a different Date Palm that
was growing at my research station at Sijbaria on the
Ganges, situated at a distance of about 200 miles from
Faridpur. The surrounding conditions were very different.
The tree was much younger; it was 2 metres in height and
inclined 20° to the vertical. The curve obtained with this
tree (Fig.&nbsp;4) was very similar to that of the Faridpur Palm,
though this extent to the movement was much reduced.
The tree attained the highest erect position at 7-15 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span> and<span class="pagenum" title="13"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span>
the lowest at 3-45 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span> Hence the movement of the Faridpur
Palm is not a solitary phenomenon.</p>


<h4>THE CAUSE OF PERIODIC MOVEMENT.</h4>

<p>The recurrent daily movement of the tree must be due
to some diurnal changes in the environment,&mdash;either the
recurrent changes of light and darkness, or the diurnal changes
of temperature. These changes synchronise to a certain
extent; for, as the sun rises, light appears and the temperature
begins to rise. It is therefore difficult to discriminate the
effect of light from that of temperature. The only satisfactory
method of discrimination would have been in the erection
of a large structure with screens to cut off light. The effect
of fluctuation of temperature under constant darkness would
have demonstrated the effect of one agent without complication
arising from the other. Unfortunately screening the tree
was impracticable. I shall presently describe other experiments
where the action of light was completely excluded.</p>

<p>The curve of movement of the tree, however, affords
us material for correct inference as regards the relative
effects of light and temperature. The experiment was
commenced in March; light appeared at about 5 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span>, the
sunrise being at 6-15 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span>; the sun set at 6-15 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>, and it
became dark by 7 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span> The incident light would be the
most intense at about noon; after this it would decline
continuously till night time. If the movement was due to
light, its climax, either in up or down movement, would
be reached at or about noon, and the opposite climax at
midnight. But instead of this we find (<a href="#fig03">Fig.&nbsp;3</a>) the up-movement
reaching its highest point not at noon, but
at 7 in the morning; after this the fall is rapid and
continuous, and the lowest position was reached not in
the evening but at 3-15 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span> The fluctuation of light has,
therefore, little to do with the movement of the tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="14"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span></p>

<p>Turning next to the element of variation of temperature
we are at once struck by the fact that the curve of movement
of the tree is practically a replica of the thermographic
curve (<a href="#fig03">Fig.&nbsp;3</a>). The <i>fall</i> of temperature is seen to
induce a <i>rise</i> in the tree and <i>vice versâ</i>. There is a lag in
the turning points of the two curves; thus while temperature
began to rise at 6 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span>, the tree did not begin to fall
till 7 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span> There is in this case a lag of an hour; but
the <i>latent</i> period may, sometimes, be as long as three hours.
The delay is due to two reasons; it must take some time
for the thick trunk of the tree to attain the temperature
of the surrounding, and secondly, the physio­logic­al inertia
will delay the reaction. As a result of other in­ves­ti­ga­tions,
I find that the induced effect always lags behind the inducing
cause. It is interesting in this connection to draw
attention to the parallel phenomenon, which is described
below, of lag in the variation of sensibility of <i>Mimosa</i> in response
to variation of temperature. In this case the lag was
found to be about three hours. Returning to the Palm, the
tree continues to fall in the forenoon with rising temperature.
At about 2-30 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span> the temperature was at its maximum
after which it began to decline; the movement of the tree
was not reversed into erection till after 3-15 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>, the lag
being now 45 minutes nearly.</p>

<p>I may state here that the movement of the tree is not
primarily affected by the periodicity of day and night, but
by variation of temperature. In spring and in early summer
the rise of temperature during the early part of the
day and the fall of the temperature from afternoon to
next morning, are regular and continuous; the corresponding
movements of the tree are also regular. But at other
seasons, owing to the sudden change of direction of the
wind, the fluctuations of temperature are irregular. Thus
at night there may be a sudden rise, and in the earlier
part of the day sudden fall of temperature. And the<span class="pagenum" title="15"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>
record of movement of the tree is found to follow these
fluctuations with astonishing fidelity, the rise of temperature
being followed by a fall of the tree and <i>vice versâ</i>.
That the movement is determined by the temperature
variation is exhibited in a striking manner in <a href="#fig04">Fig.&nbsp;4</a>,
where, between 8 and 9 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span>, a common twitch will be
noticed in the two curves.</p>

<p>While trying to obtain some clue to the mysterious movement
of the tree, my attention was strongly attracted by
certain striking similarities which the record of the movement
of the tree showed to the curve of the diurnal
variation of moto-ex­cit­abil­ity, of the pulvinus of <i>Mimosa
pudica</i>, an account of which will be found in a subsequent
Paper of the series<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></span></p>


<h4>PERIODIC MOVEMENT OF TREES AND DIURNAL VARIATION
OF MOTO-EXCITABILITY IN <i>MIMOSA PUDICA</i>.</h4>

<p>The ex­cit­abil­ity of the main pulvinus of <i>Mimosa pudica</i>
I find does not remain constant during the 24 hours, but
undergoes a striking periodic change. At certain hours of the
day, the ex­cit­abil­ity is at its maximum; at a different period
it practically disappears. The period of insensibility is about
7 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span>, which, strangely enough, is also the time when the
palm tree attains its maximum height. At about 3 in the
afternoon the ex­cit­abil­ity of <i>Mimosa</i> reaches its climax, and
this is the time when the head of the palm tree bends down
to its lowest position. For the determination of the periodic
variation of ex­cit­abil­ity of <i>Mimosa</i> I devised a special
apparatus by which an electric stimulus of constant intensity<span class="pagenum" title="16"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>
was automatically applied to the plant every hour of the
day and night, the responsive moment being recorded at
the same time. The amplitude of responsive fall of leaf
under uniform stimulus gave a measure of ex­cit­abil­ity of
the leaf at any particular moment. In the lower curve
of <a href="#fig05">Fig.&nbsp;5</a> is given the record of diurnal variation of ex­cit­abil­ity
of <i>Mimosa</i>. Comparison of this figure with Figs.
<a href="#fig03">3</a> and <a href="#fig04">4</a>, will show the remarkable resemblance between
the curves of diurnal movement of the Palm tree, and
of diurnal variation of moto-ex­cit­abil­ity of <i>Mimosa</i>. The
ex­cit­abil­ity of <i>Mimosa</i> reached its maximum at about 3<span class="pagenum" title="17"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span>
in the afternoon, when the Palm was at its lowest position.
After this hour ex­cit­abil­ity fell continuously till
7 or 8 next morning. Corresponding to this is the continuous
erection of the Palm from its lowest position
at 3 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span> to the highest between 7 and 8 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span> Still more
remarkable is the modifying influence of variation of temperature
on the diurnal curve of ex­cit­abil­ity in <i>Mimosa</i>,
and the diurnal curve of movement of the Palm. This
will be quite evident from the inspection of the temperature
curves in Figs. <a href="#fig04">4</a> and 5.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 456px;">

<div>Fig.&nbsp;5. Curve of variation of moto-ex­cit­abil­ity of <i>Mimosa pudica</i>. The upper
curve gives variation of temperature and the lower, the corresponding variation
of ex­cit­abil­ity.</div>
</div>

<p>I have shown <span class="nowrap">elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></span> that the variation of moto-ex­cit­abil­ity
of the pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i> is a physio­logic­al
function of temperature. The remarkable similarity between
the diurnal variation of moto-ex­cit­abil­ity of <i>Mimosa</i>
and diurnal movement of the Palm is due to the fact that
both are determined by the physio­logic­al action of temperature.
I shall presently describe experiments, which
will establish the physio­logic­al character of the movement
of the tree in response to changes of temperature.</p>

<p>The records that have been given show that it is the
diurnal variation of temperature, and not of light that is
effective in inducing the periodic movement of the tree.
Further experiments will be given in support of this conclusion.</p>


<h4>RELATIVE EFFECTS OF LIGHT AND TEMPERATURE.</h4>

<p>As regards the possibility of light exerting any marked
influence on the movement of the Palm tree, I have shown
from study of time-relations of the movement, that this
could not be the case. Moreover, it is impossible for light to
reach the living tissue through the thick layer of bark<span class="pagenum" title="18"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span>
that surrounds the tree. That the effect of light is negligible
will appear from the accounts of following experiments,
where the possibility of the effect of changing intensity
of light is excluded by maintaining the plant in constant
darkness, or in constant light.</p>

<p>The employment of the large Palm was obviously
impracticable in these in­ves­ti­ga­tions. I, therefore,
searched for other plant-organs in which the movement
under variation of temperature was similar to that of the
Date Palm. I found that the horizontally spread leaves of
vigorous specimens of <i>Arenga saccharifera</i> growing in a
flower pot executed movements which were practically the
same as that of the Faridpur tree. The leaf moved downwards
with rise of temperature and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>There are many practical advantages in working with
a small specimen. It can easily be placed under glass
cover or taken to a glass house, thus completely eliminating
the troublesome disturbance caused by the wind.</p>

<p><i>Diurnal movement in continued darkness: Experiment 2.</i>&mdash;The
plant was placed in a dark room and records taken
continuously for three days. These did not differ in any
way from the normal records taken in a glass house under
daily variation of light and darkness. Exposure of plant
to darkness for the very prolonged period of a week or
more, undoubtedly interferes with the healthy photo-tonic
condition of the plant. But such unhealthy condition did
not make its appearance in the first few days.</p>


<h4>PHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTER OF THE MOVEMENT.</h4>

<p>There may be a misgiving that the movement of the
tree might be due to physical effect of temperature. If the<span class="pagenum" title="19"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span>
upper strip of a differential thermometer be made of the
more expansible brass and the lower of iron, the compound
strip bends down with the rise of temperature. Similarly
the movement of the tree might be due to the upper half
being physically more expansible. It would have been
possible to discriminate the physical from the physio­logic­al
action by causing the death of the tree; in that case physical
movement would have persisted, while the physio­logic­al
action would have disappeared. As this test was
not practicable, I tried the effect of physio­logic­al depression
on the periodic movement of the leaf of <i>Arenga
saccharifera</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 435px;">
<a id="fig06"></a>
<img src="images/fig06.jpg" width="435" height="525" alt="" />
<div>Fig.&nbsp;6. Effect of physio­logic­al depression on diurnal movement of the
petiole of <i>Arenga saccharifera</i>. The uppermost curve exhibits variation of
temperature, (<i>a</i>), normal diurnal curve, (<i>b</i>), modi­fi­ca­tion after 3 days’ and (<i>c</i>)
after 7 days’ withholding of water.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Effect of Drought: Experiment 3.</i>&mdash;In Fig.&nbsp;6 is given
a series of records of movement of the leaf-stalk of <i>Arenga</i>,
first under normal condition, afterwards under increasing
drought, brought about by withholding water. The
uppermost is the thermographic record which remained
practically the same for successive days. Below this
are records of movement of the leaf (<i>a</i>) under normal
condition, (<i>b</i>) after withholding water for three days, and
(<i>c</i>) after deprivation for seven days. It will be noticed how
the extent of movement is diminished under increasing
physio­logic­al depression brought on by drought. On the
seventh day, the responsive movement disappeared, there
being now a mere fall of the leaf, which was slow and
continuous. After this I supplied the plant with water and
the periodic movement was in consequence nearly restored
to its original vigour.</p>

<p><i>Effect of poison: Experiment 4.</i>&mdash;In another experiment
the normal diurnal record with the leaf was taken and
the plant was afterwards killed by application of poisonous
solution of potassium cyanide. The diurnal movement<span class="pagenum" title="20"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>
was found permanently abolished at the death of the
plant.</p>

<p>These experiments conclusively prove that the periodic
movement of the leaf-stalk induced by variation of temperature
is a physio­logic­al phenomenon, and from analogy
we are justified in drawing the inference that the movement
of the Faridpur tree is also physio­logic­al. The
question, however, was finally settled by the unfortunate<span class="pagenum" title="21"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>
death of the tree which occurred the other day, nearly a
year after I commenced my in­ves­ti­ga­tions. While presiding
at my lecture on the subject, His Excellency Lord
Ronaldshay, the Governor of Bengal, announced that a telegram
had just reached him from his officer at Faridpur
that “the palm tree was dead, and that its movements had
ceased.”</p>

<p>Since my in­ves­ti­ga­tion with the Faridpur ‘Praying’
Palm, I have received information regarding other Palms,
which exhibit movements equally striking. One of the
trees is growing by the side of a tank, the trunk of the
tree being inclined towards it. The up-lifted leaves of
this tree are swung round in the afternoon and dipped
into the water of the tank.</p>

<p>The movement of the tree has been shown to be
brought about by the physio­logic­al action of temperature
variation; in other words the diurnal movement of the
‘Praying’ Palm is a <span class="lowercase smcap">THERMONASTIC PHENOMENON</span>. I have
found various creeping stems, branches and leaves of
many trees, exhibit this particular movement of fall with
a rise of temperature, and <i>vice versâ</i>. Such movements,
I shall, for the sake of convenience, distinguish as belonging
to the <i>negative type</i>.</p>

<p>Having found that the temperature is the modifying
cause, the next point of inquiry relates to the discovery of
the force, whose varying effects under changing temperature
induces the periodic movement. I shall, in this connection,
first discuss the various tentative theories that may
be advanced in explanation of the movement.</p>


<h4>TRANSPIRATION AND DIURNAL MOVEMENT.</h4>

<p>It may be thought that the fall of the tree during
rise of temperature may be due to passive yielding of the<span class="pagenum" title="22"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>
tree to its weight, there being increased transpiration and
general loss of turgor at high temperature. I shall, however,
show that the diurnal movement persists in the
absence of transpiration.</p>

<p><i>Diurnal movement in absence of transpiration: Experiment 5.</i>&mdash;In
the leaf of <i>Arenga saccharifera</i>, I found that
the petiole was the organ of movement. I cut off the
transpiring lamina and covered the cut end with collodion
flexile. The plant was now placed in a chamber saturated
with moisture. The petiole continued to give records of
its diurnal movement in every way similar to the record
of the intact leaf. In another experiment with the water
plant, <i>Ipoemia reptans</i>, immersed in water, the normal
diurnal movement was given by the plant, where there
could be no question of variation of turgor due to transpiration.
(See also <a href="#Experiment_7"><i>Expt.</i> 7</a>.)</p>

<p>In the diurnal movement of the ‘Praying’ Palm the
concave curvature of the rigid neck in the morning,
became flattened or slightly convex in the afternoon.
The force necessary to cause this is enormously great, and
could on no account result from the passive yielding to
the weight of the upper part of the tree.</p>

<p>From the facts given above it will be seen that the
diurnal movement is not brought about by variation in
transpiration. I now turn to another phenomenon which
appeared at first to have some connection with the movement
of the tree. Kraus found that the tissue tensions of
a shoot exhibit a daily periodicity. He, however, found
that between 10°C. and 30°C., variation of temperature
had no effect on the daily period. But as regards the
diurnal movement of the tree, it is the temperature which
is the principal factor. Kraus also found a daily variation
of bulk in different plant-organs; this variation of bulk
is connected with transpiration, for the removal of the<span class="pagenum" title="23"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span>
transpiring leaves arrested this variation. But the periodic
movement of the tree, as we have seen, is independent
of transpiration.</p>

<p>Millardet observed a daily periodicity of tension in
<i>Mimosa pudica</i>. He found that maximum tension occurs
before dawn; the petiole becomes erected, the movement
being upwards or towards the tip of the stem. Tension
decreases during the day, and reaches a minimum early
in the evening; in correspondence with this is the fall
of the petiole, the movement being away from the tip
of the stem<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></span> If the plant were placed upside down the
periodic movement of the petiole in relation to the stem
will evidently remain the same, but become reversed in
space. Maximum tension in the morning will make the
petiole approach the tip of the stem, <i>i.e.</i>, the movement
will be <i>downwards</i> instead of upwards as in the normal
position. The experiment described below will show that
the diurnal movement induced by variation of temperature
is not reversed by placing the plant in an inverted position.</p>

<p><i>Diurnal movement in inverted position: Experiment 6.</i>&mdash;I
took a vigorous specimen of <i>Arenga saccharifera</i> growing
in a pot, and took its normal record, which as explained
before exhibited down-movement during rise, and an up-movement
during fall of temperature. The plant was now
held inverted, the upper side of the petiole now facing the
earth. The diurnal curve of movement should now show
an inversion, if that movement was solely determined by
the anisotropy of the organ. But the record did not exhibit
any such inversion. After being placed upside down, the
leaf did not, on the first day, show any diurnal movement;
there was, on the other hand, a continuous down-movement<span class="pagenum" title="24"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>
on account of the fall of the leaf by its own weight.
But in the course of 24 hours the leaf readjusted itself to
its unaccustomed position, and became somewhat erected
under the action of geotropic stimulus. After the attainment
of this new state of geotropic equilibrium, the leaf
gave a very pronounced record of its diurnal movement
which did not show any reversal; the inverted leaf continued
to exhibit the same char­ac­ter­is­tic movements as in
the normal position, that is to say, a down movement
during rise, and an up-movement during fall of temperature.
As the plant in the inverted position did not show any
reversal of the periodic curve, it is clear that the diurnal
movement is determined by the modifying influence of
temperature on the physio­logic­al reaction of the plant to
some external stimulus which is constant in direction. I
shall presently show that it is the constant geotropic stimulus
modified by the action of temperature, which determines the
diurnal movement of the tree.</p>

<p>This will be better understood if I refer once more to
certain characteristics in the movement of the “Praying”
Palm. The neck of the tree was seen to be concave in
the morning. The physio­logic­al effect of raising temperature
is virtually to oppose or neutralise the geotropic curvature
as seen in the flattening or slight reversal of curvature
in the afternoon. Similarly, various plant organs, growing
at an inclination to the vertical, are subjected to geotropic
action, and thus assume different char­ac­ter­is­tic angles. This
state of equilibrium is not static but may better be described
as dynamic; for it will be shown that this state of
geotropic balance is upset in a definite way, by variation
of temperature.</p>

<p>That geotropism is an important factor in the diurnal
movement is supported by the fact that the Sijbaria Palm with
an inclination of 20° to the vertical exhibited a daily<span class="pagenum" title="25"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>
movement which was only moderate in extent. But the
Faridpur Palm growing at an inclination of 60° was
subjected more effectively to geotropic action, and exhibited
movements which were far more pronounced. I shall now
proceed to describe crucial experiments which will demonstrate
the effect of change of temperature on geotropic
curvature.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF VARIATION OF TEMPERATURE ON GEOTROPIC
CURVATURE.</h4>

<p>In the instances of diurnal movement already described
the trees or their leaves were already at an inclination to
the vertical. I now took a radial and erect shoot of
<i>Basella cordifolia</i> growing in a pot and laid it horizontally
for two weeks. The procumbent stem curved up and
attained a state of equilibrium under the action of geotropic
stimulus.</p>

<p><i>Diurnal curve of</i> Basella cordifolia: <i><a id="Experiment_7"></a>Experiment 7.</i>&mdash;The
plant was completely immersed in a vessel of water,
and its diurnal curve recorded. This resembled in all
essentials the diurnal curve of the Palm; the slight
deviation was due to the fact that owing to difference in
the season (August) the temperature maximum was attained
at 12-25 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span> and the minimum at 6 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span> The geotropic
curvature was reduced to its minimum at the maximum
temperature, and <i>vice versâ</i>. As in the case of the Palm
so also in the procumbent stem of <i>Basella</i> there was a
physio­logic­al lag, which was 50 minutes in the morning
and about the same in the afternoon. The free end of
the stem thus exhibited a diurnal movement up and down.
The temperature, as stated before, began to rise from
6 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span> and the down-movement commenced 50 minutes<span class="pagenum" title="26"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>
later, <i>i.e.</i>, at 6-50 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span> The temperature, after reaching
the maximum, began to fall at 12-25 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>, and the previous
movement of fall of the stem was arrested and
reversed into an erectile movement shortly after 1 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>
There are thus two “turning points,” one at 7 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span>, and
the other at about 1 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>; at these periods the movement
of the plant remains more or less arrested for more than
half-an-hour.</p>

<img src="images/fig07.jpg" width="452" height="329" alt="" />
<div>Fig.&nbsp;7. Diurnal curve of movement of procumbent young stem of <i>Mimosa
pudica</i>. Successive dots at intervals of 15 minutes.</div>
</div>

<p>I obtained records of similar diurnal movements with
various procumbent or creeping stems. Figure 7 gives the
diurnal record of the procumbent stem of a young specimen
of <i>Mimosa pudica</i>.</p>

<p>The experiment that has just been described shows
clearly that geotropic curvatures of stems is opposed, or
neutralised to a greater or less extent, during rise of temperature,
and this antagonistic reaction is removed during
the fall of temperature. The diurnal movement of the<span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>
plant completely immersed under water shows once more
that transpiration has little to do with the diurnal movement.</p>


<h4>REVERSAL OF NATURAL RHYTHM.</h4>

<p>The diurnal rhythm of up and down movement in
the particular specimen <i>Basella</i> had become established
under the daily variation of temperature. I now attempted
to reverse this rhythm by artificial variation of temperature.
The plant was placed in water in a rectangular
metallic vessel which was placed within a second outer
vessel. The plant could thus be subjected, without any
mechanical disturbance, to variation of temperature, by
circulating warm or cold water in the outer vessel. In
order to reverse the natural rhythm I subjected the plant
to the action of falling temperature at the “turning” point
at 7 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span>, at a time when the plant would have undergone
a down-movement under the daily rise of temperature.
Conversely the plant was subjected to the action of rising
temperature at the second “turning” point at 1 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span> when
the movement under diurnal fall of temperature would
have been one of erection.</p>

<p><i>Effect of fall of temperature: Experiment 8.</i>&mdash;As stated
before the experiment was carried out in the morning;
ice cold water was circulated in the outer chamber, the
fall of temperature was in this case sudden, and there was
an almost immediate responsive movement. This appeared
anomalous, since the latent period of response to slow
variation of temperature was found from the diurnal curve
to be as long as 50 minutes.</p>

<p>As a result of further in­ves­ti­ga­tions I found that variation
of temperature produces two different effects which may be
distinguished as transient and persistent. Sudden variation
of temperature affects the superficial tissue, and gives rise<span class="pagenum" title="28"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>
to a transient reaction, while it takes a long time for
temperature variation to react on the geotropically active
tissue in the interior. The persistent effect therefore takes
place after a latent period from one to three hours according
to the thickness of the plant.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 521px;">

of temperature.</div><div style="width: 250px; display: inline-block;">Fig.&nbsp;9. Responsive fall of <i>Basella</i> to gradual rise of temperature.
(Dots at intervals of 5 minutes).</div>
</div>

<p>The persistent effect of rise of temperature is a movement
downwards, that of fall of temperature is a movement
upwards. These definite reactions will be seen
exhibited in Figs. 8 and 9. The plant was stationary at the
turning point in the morning hence the curve at first was
horizontal. The temperature was gradually lowered through
5°C., from 29°C., to 24°C. in the course of five minutes
and maintained at the lower temperature. There was no
immediate effect, but after a latent period of 65 minutes
the plant responded by a movement of erection. The
natural movement at this period of the day would have
been one of fall, but artificial change of temperature in
the opposite direction effectively reversed the normal
diurnal movement. The latent period for this reverse<span class="pagenum" title="29"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>
movement is, as stated before, 65 minutes as against 50
minutes in the normal diurnal movement. The increase
in the latent period is probably due to the added physio­logic­al
inertia in reversing the normal rhythm.</p>

<p><i>Effect of rise of temperature: Experiment 9.</i>&mdash;The temperature
was raised through 5°C at the second turning point,
at 1 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span> After a latent period of 50 minutes the plant
began to rise steadily (<a href="#fig08-09">Fig. 9</a>) thus exhibit­ing once more
the reversal of its normal diurnal movement.</p>

<p>From the experiments described above it will be seen
that the movement of the Palm, and of other organs growing
at an inclination to the vertical, is brought about by the
action of temperature in modifying the geotropic curvature.
The ever present tendency of geotropic movement is opposed
or helped by the physio­logic­al reaction induced by rise
and fall of temperature respectively. The state of equilibrium
is never permanent, but the dynamic balance is
being constantly readjusted under changing conditions of
the environment.</p>

<p>The movement of the tree furnishes an example of
the <i>negative</i> type of <span class="lowercase smcap">THERMONASTIC MOVEMENT</span>. Parallel
phenomena are found in floral organs, where, in the well-known
instance of <i>Crocus</i>, the perianth leaves open outwards
during rise of temperature and close inwards during
the onset of cold. Looked at from above, the opening outwards
during rise of temperature is a movement downwards,
and therefore belongs to the <i>negative type</i>. In such cases
the changed rate of growth by variation of temperature
is the most important factor in the movement. It may
be asked whether all thermonastic movements must necessarily
belong to the <i>negative</i> type, where rise of temperature
is attended by a movement downwards. I shall in
my Paper on “Thermonastic Phenomena” show that there<span class="pagenum" title="30"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>
is also a <i>positive type</i> where rise of temperature induces an
up-movement or of closure.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The ‘Praying’ Palm of Faridpur, growing at an
inclination of about 60° to the vertical, exhibited a diurnal
movement by which its head became erected in the morning
and depressed towards the afternoon, the outspread leaves
pressing against the ground.</p>

<p>The record of the diurnal movement showed that the
head was erected to the highest position between 7 and 8
in the morning, after which there was a continuous fall
which reached its climax at 3-15 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>; after this the movement
was reversed and the maximum erection was again
reached next morning.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is not unique, but is found exhibited,
more or less, by all trees and their branches and leaves.</p>

<p>Diurnal records of temperature, and movement of the
tree showed, that the two curves closely resembled each
other. Rise of temperature was attended by a fall of the
tree, and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>The movement is brought about by the physio­logic­al
action of temperature; it may be arrested by artificially
induced physio­logic­al depression, and is permanently
abolished at death.</p>

<p>The movement is primarily determined by the modifying
influence of temperature on geotropic curvature. Rise
of temperature is found to oppose or neutralise geotropic
curvature, the fall of temperature inducing the opposite
effect. The ever present tendency of upwards geotropic
movement is opposed or helped by the effects of rise and
fall of temperature respectively.</p>

<p>The movement of the ‘Praying’ Palm is a thermonastic
phenomenon. The tree, apparently so rigid, responds as a
gigantic pulvinoid to the changes of its environment.</p>

<p>The leaf of <i>Mimosa pudica</i> undergoes a rapid fall when
subjected to any kind of shock. This plant has, therefore,
been regarded as “sensitive,” in contra­distinction to ordinary
plants which remain apparently immobile under external
stimulus. I shall, however, show in course of this Paper
that there is no justification in regarding ordinary plants
as insensitive.</p>

<p>Let us first take any radial organ of a plant and subject
it to an electric shock. It will be found that the organ
undergoes a contraction in length in response to the
stimulus. On the cessation of excitation the specimen
gradually recovers its original length. Different organs of
plant may be employed for the experiment, for example,
the tendril of <i>Cucurbita</i>, the pistil of <i>Datura</i>, or the
flower bud of <i>Crinum</i>. The shortening may be observed by
means of a low power microscope. Greater importance is,
however, attached to the detailed study of response and its
time relations. The pull exerted by a delicate organ during
its excitatory contraction is slight; hence arises the neces<span class="pagenum" title="32"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>sity
of devising a very sensitive apparatus, which would
give records magnified from ten to a hundred times.</p>


<h4>RESPONSE RECORDERS.</h4>

<p>The mag­ni­fi­ca­tion of movement is produced by a light
lever, the short arm of which is attached to the plant
organ, the long arm tracing the record on a moving smoked
plate of glass. The axis of the lever is supported by jewel
bearings. The principal difficulty in obtaining accurate
record of response of plant lies in the friction of contact
of the recording point against the glass surface. This
difficulty I have been able to overcome by providing a
device of intermittent instead of continuous contact. For
this, either the writer is made to vibrate to and fro, or
the recording plate is made to oscillate backwards and
forwards.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Resonant Recorder.</i>&mdash;In this the writing lever is
made of a fine steel wire. One end of this wire is supported
at the centre of a circular electromagnet; this latter is
periodically magnetised by a coercing vibrator, which completes
an electric circuit <ins title="Transcriber’s note: Original wording, but probably should read ‘ten, hundred,’ judging by later text.">ten hundred,</ins> or two hundred times
in a second. The writing lever is exactly tuned to the
vibrating interrupter and is thus thrown into sympathetic
vibration. Successive dots in the record thus measure time
from 0.1 to 0.05 second. The employment of the Resonant
Recorder enables us to measure extremely short periods of
time for the determination of the latent period or the
velocity of trans­mission of excitation<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <i>The Magnetic Tapper.</i>&mdash;Measurement of very short
intervals is not necessary in ordinary records of res<span class="pagenum" title="33"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>ponse.
In this type of recorders, the circular magnet is
therefore excited at longer intervals, from several seconds
to several minutes; this is done by completion of the
electric circuit at the required intervals, by means of a
key operated by a clock.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Mechanical Tapper.</i>&mdash;In this, magnetic tapping
is discarded in favour of mechanical tapping. The hinged
writing lever is periodically pressed against the recording
plate by a long arm, actuated by clock-work.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Oscillating Recorder.</i>&mdash;Here the plate itself is
made to oscillate to-and-fro by eccentric worked by a
clock. The frame carrying the plate moves on ball-bearings.
The advantage of the Oscillating Recorder lies in
the fact that a long lever, made of fine glass fibre, or
of aluminium wire, may be employed for giving high
mag­ni­fi­ca­tion. A mag­ni­fi­ca­tion of a hundred times may
be easily obtained by making the short arm 2.5&nbsp;mm. and
the long arm 25&nbsp;cm. in length<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></span></p>


<h4>RESPONSE OF A RADIAL ORGAN.</h4>

<div>Fig.&nbsp;10. Response of a straight tendril of <i>Passiflora</i> to electric shock. Suc­ces­sive
dots at inter­vals of 5 seconds. The ver­ti­cal lines below are at inter­vals
of a min­ute. In this and in all fol­low­ing records (unless stated to the contrary)
up-curve rep­re­sents con­trac­tion, and down-curve ex­pan­sion or re­cov­ery.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Experiment 10.</i>&mdash;As a typical example I shall describe the
response of a straight tendril of <i>Passiflora</i>. A cut specimen
was mounted with its lower end in water. Suitable electric
connections were made for sending a feeble induction shock
of short duration through the specimen. In this and all
other records, unless contrary be stated, up-curve represents
contractile movement. On application of stimulus
of electric shock, an excitatory movement of contraction
occurred which shortly reached its maximum; the apex-time
was one minute and forty seconds, and recovery
was completed after a further period of five minutes<span class="pagenum" title="34"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
(Fig.&nbsp;10). Stronger shocks induce greater contraction
with prolongation of the period of recovery. The specimen
was afterwards killed by application of poisonous
solution of potassium cyanide; this brought about a permanent
abolition of response. The experiment just
described may be taken as typical of response of radial
organs.</p>

<p>In a radial organ contraction takes place equally in
all directions; it therefore shortens in length, there being
no movement in a lateral plane. But if any agency
renders one side less excitable than its opposite, diffuse
stimulation will then induce greater contraction on the more
excitable side which will therefore become concave.</p>


<h4>RESPONSE OF AN ANISOTROPIC ORGAN.</h4>

<p>Excessive stimulation is found to reduce the ex­cit­abil­ity
of an organ. Under unilateral mechanical stimulation a<span class="pagenum" title="35"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>
tendril of <i>Passiflora</i> becomes hooked or coiled, the concave
being the excited side. From what has been said,
the unexcited convex side will relatively be the more
excitable.</p>

<div>Fig.&nbsp;11. Response of a hooked tendril of <i>Passiflora</i> to electric shock. Successive
dots at intervals of 5 seconds.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Experiment 11.</i>&mdash;I took a specimen of hooked tendril,
and excited it by an electric shock. The response was
by the greater contraction of the more excitable convex
side, on account of which the curved specimen tended to
open out. The record of this response is seen in Fig.&nbsp;11;
the apex-time was nearly two minutes, and the recovery
was completed in the further course of 15 minutes.</p>

<p>From the responses of organs rendered anisotropic by the
differential action of the environment we pass to others
which show certain amount of anatomical and physio­logic­al
differentiation between their upper and lower sides. I
find that many petioles of leaves show movement in response
to stimulus. Many pulvini, generally regarded as<span class="pagenum" title="36"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>
insensitive, are also found to exhibit responsive movements.</p>


<h4>RESPONSE OF THE PULVINUS OF <i>MIMOSA PUDICA</i>.</h4>

<img src="images/fig12.jpg" width="263" height="259" alt="" />
<div>Fig.&nbsp;12. Response of the main pulvinus of <i>Mimosa pudica</i>.</div>
</div>

<p>The most striking and familiar example of response is
afforded by the main pulvinus of <i>Mimosa pudica</i> of which
a record is given in Fig.&nbsp;12. It is generally assumed
that sensibility is confined to the lower half of the organ.
It will be shown in a subsequent Paper that this is not
the case. The upper half of the pulvinus is also sensitive
though in a feeble degree, its ex­cit­abil­ity being about 80
times less than that of the lower half. On diffuse stimulation
the predominant contraction of the lower half causes
the fall of the leaf, the antagonistic reaction of the upper
half being, in practice, negligible. In order to avoid unnecessary
repetition, I shall ignore the feeble antagonistic
reaction of the less excitable half of the organ, and shall
use the word ‘contraction’ for ‘relatively greater contraction.’</p>

<p>It is interesting in this connection to refer to the response
of the leaf of Water Mimosa (<i>Neptunia oleracea</i>).
Here the reaction is very sluggish in comparison with that
of <i>Mimosa pudica</i>. A tabular statement of contractile response
of various radial, anisotropic and pulvinated organs

exhibited is a question of degree and not of kind.</p>

<p>As regards the excitatory fall of the leaf of
<i>Mimosa pudica</i>, Pfeffer and Haberlandt are of opinion
that this is due to the sudden diminution of turgor in the
excited lower half of the pulvinus. The weight of the
leaf, no longer supported by the distended lower cells,
causes it to fall. This is accentuated by the expansion of
the upper half of the pulvinus which is normally in a state
of compression. According to this view the excitatory fall
of the leaf is a passive, rather than an active, movement.
I have, however, found that in determining the rapidity of<span class="pagenum" title="38"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span>
the fall of <i>Mimosa</i> leaf the factors of expansive force of
the upper half of the pulvinus and the weight of the leaf
are negligible compared to the active force of contraction
exerted by the lower half of the pulvinus (<a href="#Page_87">p.&nbsp;87</a>).</p>

<p>With regard to the fall of turgor, it is not definitely
known whether excitation causes a sudden diminution in the
osmotic strength of the cell-sap or an increase in the
permeability of the ectoplast to the osmotic constituents
of the cell. Pfeffer favours the former view, while others
support the theory of variation of permeability<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></span></p>


<h4>RESPONSE OF PULVINUS OF <span class="smcap"><i>MIMOSA</i></span> TO VARIATION OF
TURGOR.</h4>

<p>Whatever difference of opinion there may be in regard
to the theories of osmotic and permeability variations, we
have the indubitable fact of diminution of turgor and
contractile fall of the pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i> under excitation.
The restoration of the original turgor brings about
recovery and erection of the leaf. In connection with
this the following experiments on responsive movements
of the leaf under artificial variation of turgor will be
found of <span class="nowrap">interest:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="39"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Effect of Increased Turgor: <a id="Experiment_12"></a>Experiment 12.</i>&mdash;A young
<i>Mimosa</i> plant was carefully transplanted and the root
embedded in soil placed in a linen bag. This was held
securely by a clamp, and one of the leaves of the plant
attached to the recorder. Withholding of water for a day
caused a general loss of turgor of the plant. A vessel
full of water was now raised from below so that the
linen bag containing the roots was now in water. The
effect of increased turgor by suction of water by the
roots became apparent by the <i>upward</i> movement of the
leaf. The distance between the immersed portion of the
plant and the leaf was 2&nbsp;cm. and the up-movement of
the leaf was indicated within 10 seconds of application of
water (Fig.&nbsp;13). The velocity with which the effect of<span class="pagenum" title="40"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span>
increased turgor travelled was thus 2&nbsp;mm. per second.
The leaf exhibited increasing erection with absorption of
water.</p>

<div>Fig.&nbsp;13. Response of <i>Mimosa</i> pulvinus to variation of turgor. Increased turgor
by application of water at point marked with vertical arrow induced erectile movement.
Diminution of turgor by application of KNO<sub>3</sub> solution at the point marked
with the horizontal arrow, brought about the fall of the leaf within 80 seconds.
Successive dots at intervals of 5 seconds (The down curve represents up-movement
and <i>vice versâ</i>.)</div>
</div>

<p><i>Effect of Diminution of Turgor: Experiment 13.</i>&mdash;While
the leaf in the above experiment was in process of
erection, a quick change was made by substituting KNO<sub>3</sub>
solution for the water of the vessel in which the roots
were immersed. The plasmolytic withdrawal of water at
the roots gave rise to a wave of diminished turgor, the
effect of which became perceptible within 40 seconds by
the movement of <i>fall</i> of the leaf. (Fig.&nbsp;13.)</p>


<h4>DIFFERENT MODES OF STIMULATION.</h4>

<p>In <i>Mimosa</i> excitation is manifested by the contraction
of the pulvinus and the consequent movement of the leaf.
But in most plants, excitatory movement cannot be realized
on account of the rigidity of the plant structure, the
thickness of the cell-wall and the want of facility for
escape of water from the excited cells. I shall show later
how excitation may be detected in the absence of mechanical
movement.</p>

<p>As regards stimulation of vegetable tissues, there are
various agencies besides electric shock, which induce excitatory
contraction; these agencies I shall designate as stimuli.
Excitation is detected in <i>Mimosa</i> by the downward movement
of the leaf. It will be found that such excitatory
movement is caused by a mechanical blow, by a prick or
a cut, by the application of certain chemical agents, by
the action of electric current and by the action of strong
light. The study of the action of these stimuli will be
given in greater detail in subsequent Papers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="41"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span></p>

<p>I shall give below a general classification of different
stimuli which cause excitation in vegetable tissues.</p>

<p><i>Electric Stimulus.</i>&mdash;Induction shock, condenser discharge,
the make of kathode and the break of anode.</p>

<p><i>Mechanical Stimulus.</i>&mdash;Mechanical blow, friction, prick
or cut.</p>

<p><i>Chemical Stimulus.</i>&mdash;Effect of certain acids and of
other chemical substances.</p>

<p><i>Thermal Stimulus.</i>&mdash;Sudden variation of temperature;
application of heated wire.</p>

<p><i>Radiation Stimulus.</i>&mdash;Luminous radiation of the more
refrangible portion of the spectrum; ultra-violet rays;
thermal radiation in the infra-red region.</p>

<p>All these different forms of stimulus induce an excitatory
contraction, a diminution of turgor, and a negative
mechanical response or fall of a motile leaf.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>A radial organ responds to stimulus by contraction in
length; as all its flanks are equally excitable there is no
lateral movement under diffuse stimulus.</p>

<p>Physiological anisotropy is induced in an organ, originally
radial and isotropic, by the unequal action of the environment
on its different sides. Diffuse stimulus induces a
greater contraction of the more excitable side.</p>

<p>In a curved tendril the concave side is less excitable
than the convex. Diffuse stimulus tends to straighten
the curved tendril.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="42"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span></p>

<p>In the pulvinus of <i>Mimosa pudica</i>, the lower half is
eighty times more excitable than the upper, and the fall of
the leaf is due to the predominant contraction of the more
excitable lower half.</p>

<p>A diminution of turgor takes place in the excited cells.
Restoration of turgor brings about recovery of the leaf
to its normal erect position. Independent experiments show
that the fall of the leaf may be brought about by an
artificial diminution of turgor, and the erection of the leaf
by an increase of turgor.</p>

<h3>IV.&mdash;DIURNAL VARIATION OF MOTO-EXCITABILITY IN <i>MIMOSA</i></h3>

<p class="tac mt1em">BY</p>

<p class="tac mtb1em"><span class="smcap">Sir J.&nbsp;C. Bose.</span></p>

<p>Several phenomena of daily periodicity are known,
but the relations between the recurrent external changes and
the resulting periodic variations are more or less obscure.
As an example of this may be cited the periodic variation
of growth. Here the daily periodicity exhibited by a
plant is not only different in varying seasons, but it also
differs in diverse species of plants. The complexity of the
problem is very great, for not only are the direct effects
of the changing environment to be taken into consideration
but also their unknown after-effects. Even in the case of
direct effect, different factors, such as light, temperature,
turgor, and so on, are undergoing independent variations;
it may thus happen that their reactions may sometimes be
concordant and at other times discordant. The nyctitropic
movement of plants affords another example of daily periodicity.
The fanciful name of ‘sleep’ is often given to
the closure of the leaflets of certain plants at night. The
question whether plants sleep or not may be put in the
form of the definite inquiry: Is the plant equally excitable
throughout day and night? If not, is there any definite
period at which it practically loses its ex­cit­abil­ity? Is
there, again, another period at which the plant wakes up,
as it were, to a condition of maximum ex­cit­abil­ity?</p>

<p>In the course of my in­ves­ti­ga­tions on the irritability
of <i>Mimosa pudica</i>, I became aware of the existence of such
a daily periodicity; that is to say, the moto-ex­cit­abil­ity
of the pulvinus was found to be markedly diminished
or even completely abolished at a certain definite period<span class="pagenum" title="44"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>
of the day; at another equally definite period, the ex­cit­abil­ity
was observed to have attained its climax. The
observations on the periodic variation of ex­cit­abil­ity appeared
at first to be extremely puzzling. It might be
thought, for example, that light would prove to be favourable
for moto-ex­cit­abil­ity; in actual experiment the results
apparently contradicted such a supposition: for the ex­cit­abil­ity
of the plant was found much higher in the evening
than in the morning. Favourable temperature, again,
might be regarded as an important factor for the enhancement
of the moto-ex­cit­abil­ity; it was, nevertheless,
found that though the excitatory response was only
moderate at that period of night when the temperature
was at its minimum, yet the ex­cit­abil­ity was altogether
abolished at another period when the temperature was
several degrees higher. The obscurities which surrounded
the subject were only removed as a result of protracted
in­ves­ti­ga­tion and comparison of continuous automatic records
made by the plant itself during several months,
beginning with winter and ending in summer.</p>

<p>The question whether a plant like <i>Mimosa</i> exhibits
diurnal variation of ex­cit­abil­ity can be experimentally investigated
by subjecting the plant at every hour of the
day and night to a test-stimulus of uniform intensity, and
obtaining the corresponding mechanical responses. Under
these circumstances the amplitude of response at any
time will serve as a measure of the ex­cit­abil­ity of the
plant at the particular time. Any periodic fluctuation of
response will then demonstrate the periodic character of
variation of ex­cit­abil­ity.</p>

<p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tion thus resolves itself <span class="nowrap">into:&mdash;</span></p>


<p class="pl3hi">The successful construction of a Response Recorder
which will automatically record the response of

The leaf of <i>Mimosa</i> is attached to one arm of a
light aluminium lever, L, by means of thread. At right
angles to the lever is the writing index W, which traces on
a smoked glass plate allowed to fall at a definite rate
by clockwork the responsive movement of the leaf. Under
a definite stimulus of electric shock the leaf falls down,
pulling the lever L, and moving the writer towards the
left. (Fig.&nbsp;14.) The amplitude of the response-curve<span class="pagenum" title="46"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>
measures the intensity of excitation. The leaf re-erects
itself after a time, the corresponding record exhibit­ing
recovery. A second stimulus is applied after a definite
interval, say an hour, and the corresponding response
shows whether the ex­cit­abil­ity of the plant has remained
constant or undergone any variation.</p>

<h4>UNIFORM PERIODIC STIMULATION.</h4>

<p><i>Electric mode of excitation.</i>&mdash;I find that one of the
best methods of stimulating the plant is by means of
tetanizing induction shock. The sensitiveness of <i>Mimosa</i>
to electric stimulation is very great; the plant often
responds to a shock which is quite imperceptible to a
human subject. By the employment of a sliding induction
coil, the intensity of the shock can be regulated with
great accuracy; the secondary if gradually brought nearer
the primary till a stimulus is found which is minimally
effective. The intensity of stimulus actually employed is
slightly higher than this, but within the sub-maximal
range. When the testing stimulus is maintained constant
and of sub-maximal intensity, then any variation of ex­cit­abil­ity
is attended by a corresponding variation in the
amplitude of response.</p>

<p>The exciting value of a tetanizing electric shock depends
(1) on the intensity, (2) on the duration of shock. The
intensity may be rendered uniform by placing the secondary
at a fixed distance from the primary, and keeping
the current in the primary circuit constant. The constancy
of the current in primary circuit is secured by the employment
of an accumulator or storage cell of definite electromotive
force. It is far more difficult to secure the constant
duration of the tetanizing shock in successive stimulations<span class="pagenum" title="47"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span>
at intervals of, say, one hour during twenty-four hours.
The duration of the induction shock given by the secondary
coil depends on the length of time during which the
primary circuit is completed in successive excitations. I
have succeeded in overcoming the difficulty of securing
uniformity of duration of shock by the employment of a
special clockwork device.</p>

<p><i>The clockwork plunger.</i>&mdash;The alarum clock can be so
arranged that a wheel is suddenly released and allowed
to complete one rapid revolution at intervals of, say, one
hour. There is a fan-governor by which the speed of
the revolution can be regulated and maintained constant.
This will specially be the case when the alarum spring
is long and fully wound. The succession of short releases
twenty-four times during the day produce relatively little
unwinding of the spring. On account of this and the
presence of the fan-governor, the period of a single revolution
of the wheel remains constant. By means of an
eccentric the circular movement is converted into an up
and down movement. The plunging rod R thus dips into
a cup of mercury M, for a definite short interval and
is then lifted off. The duration of closure can be regulated
by raising or lowering the cup of mercury. In
practice the duration of tetanizing shock is about 0.2
second.</p>

<p>The same clock performs three functions. The axis
which revolves once in twelve hours has attached to it
a wheel, and round this is wound a thread which allows
the recording glass plate to fall through six inches in
the course of twenty-four hours. A spoke attached to the
minute hand releases the alarum at regular and pre-determined
intervals of time, say once in an hour. The
plunging rod R, actuated by the eccentric, causes a<span class="pagenum" title="48"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>
tetanizing shock of uniform intensity and duration to be
given to the plant at specified times.</p>

<p><i>Constancy of resistance in the secondary circuit.</i>&mdash;In
order that the testing electric stimulus shall remain uniform,
another condition has to be fulfilled, namely, the
maintenance of constancy of resistance in the secondary
circuit, including the plant. Electric connections have to
be made with the latter by means of cloth moistened with
dilute salt solution; drying of the salt solution, however,
gives rise to a variation of resistance in the electrolytic
contact. This difficulty is overcome by making the electrolytic
resistance negligible compared to the resistance
offered by the plant. Thin and flexible spirals of silver
tinsel attached to the electrodes E, E′ are tied round the
petiole and the stem, respectively. In order to secure better
electric contact, a small strip of cloth moistened with
dilute salt and glycerine is wound round the tinsel. As
the resistance of contact is relatively small, and as drying
is to a great extent retarded by glycerine, the total resistance
of the secondary circuit undergoes practically no
variation in the course of twenty-four hours. This will
be seen from the following data. An experiment was
commenced one day at 1 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>, when the resistance offered by
8&nbsp;cm. length of stem and 2&nbsp;cm. length of petiole was found
to be 1.5 million ohms. After twenty-four hours’ record, the
resistance was measured the next day and was found unchanged.
The fact that the stimulus remains perfectly
uniform will be quite apparent when the records given
in the course of this paper are examined in detail.</p>


<h4>THE RESPONSE RECORDER.</h4>

<p>The amplitude of response affords, as we have seen, a
measure of the ex­cit­abil­ity of the plant. In actual<span class="pagenum" title="49"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>
record friction of the writer against the glass surface becomes
a source of error. This difficulty I have been able to
overcome by the two independent devices, the Resonant
Recorder and the Oscillating Recorder. In the former the
writer is maintained by electric means in a state of continuous
to and fro vibration, about ten times in a second.
There is thus no continuous contact between the writer
and the smoked glass surface, friction being thereby
practically eliminated. The writer in this case taps a
record, the successive dots occurring at intervals of 0.1
second. The responsive fall of the leaf is rapid, hence
the successive dots in this part of the record are widely
spaced; but the erection of the leaf during recovery
takes place slowly, hence the recovery part of the curve
appears continuous on account of the superposition of the
successive dots. The advantage of the Resonant Recorder
is that the curve exhibits both response and recovery.
This apparatus is admirably suited for experiments which
last for a few hours. There is, however, some drawback
to its use in experiments which are continued for days
together. This will be understood when we remember
that for the maintenance of 10 vibrations of the writer
in a second, 10 electric contacts have to be made; in
other words, 36,000 intermittent electric currents have to
be kept up per hour. This necessitates the employment of
an electric accumulator having a very large capacity.</p>

<p>In the Oscillating Recorder the recording plate itself
moves to and fro, making intermittent contact with the
writer about once in a minute. The recording smoked
glass plate is allowed to fall at a definite rate by the
unwinding of a clock wheel. By an electro­magnetic
arrangement the holder of the smoked glass plate is made
to oscillate to and fro, causing periodic contact with the
writer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="50"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 346px;">
<a id="fig15"></a>
<img src="images/fig15.jpg" width="346" height="418" alt="" />
<div><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 15. The Oscillator. Electromagnet M, M′, periodically magnetized by
completion of electric current by clockwork C. Periodic attraction of soft iron
armature A moves attached glass plate G to left, making thereby electric
contact with writer.</div>
</div>

<p>The Oscillator is diagrammatically shown in Fig. 15.
M, M′ are the two electro­magnetic coils, the free ends of
the horseshoe being pointed. Facing them are the conical
holes of the soft iron armature A. This armature carries
two rods which slide through hollow tubes. The distal
ends of the rods support the holder H, carrying the
smoked glass plate. Under normal conditions, the plate-holder
is held by suitable springs, somewhat to the right
of, and free from contact with, the writer. A clockwork
C carries a rotating arm, which makes periodic contact
with a pool of mercury contained in the vessel V, once
in a minute. On the completion of the electro­magnetic
circuit, the armature A is attracted, the recording glass
plate being thereby moved to the left making contact with<span class="pagenum" title="51"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span>
the writer. The successive dots in the record thus take place
at intervals of a minute. Only a moderate amount of electric
current is thus consumed in maintaining the oscillation
of the plate. A 4-volt storage cell of 20 amperes capacity
is quite sufficient to work the apparatus for several days.</p>

<p>The responsive fall of the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i> is completed
in the course of about two seconds. The leaf remains in
the fallen or ‘contracted’ position for nearly fifteen
seconds; it then begins to recover slowly. As the successive
dots of the Oscillating Recorder are at intervals of a
minute, the maximum fall of leaf is accomplished between
two successive dots. The dotted response record
here obtained exhibits the recovery from maximum fall
under stimulation (<i>cf.</i> <a href="#fig23">Fig.&nbsp;23</a>). The recovery of the leaf
in one minute is less than one-tenth the total amplitude
of the fall, and is proportionately the same in all the
response records. Hence the successive amplitudes of response
curves that are recorded at different hours of the
day afford us measures of the relative variations of ex­cit­abil­ity
of the plant at different times. This enables us
to demonstrate the reality of diurnal variation of ex­cit­abil­ity.
In my experimental in­ves­ti­ga­tions on the subject
I have not been content to take my data from any
particular method of obtaining response, but have employed
both types of recorders, the Resonant and Oscillating. It
will be shown that the results given by the different instruments
are in complete agreement with each other.</p>


<h4>EFFECTS OF EXTERNAL CONDITIONS ON EXCITABILITY.</h4>

<p>Before giving the daily records of periodic variation
of ex­cit­abil­ity, I will give my experimental results on the
influence of various external conditions in modifying ex­cit­abil­ity.
The conditions which are likely to affect ex­cit­abil­ity
and induce periodicity are, first, the effects of
light and darkness: under natural conditions the plant is<span class="pagenum" title="52"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>
subjected in the morning to the changing condition from
darkness to light; then to the action of continued light
during the day; and in the evening to the changing
condition from light to darkness. A second periodic factor
is the change in the condition of turgidity, which is at
its maximum in the morning, as evidenced by the
char­ac­ter­is­tic erect position of the petiole. Finally, the
plant in the course of day and night is subjected to a
great variation of temperature. I will now describe the
effects of these various factors on ex­cit­abil­ity. It should
be mentioned here that the experiments were carried out
about the middle of the day, when the ex­cit­abil­ity,
generally speaking, is found to remain constant.</p>


<h4>EFFECTS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS.</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 470px;">
<a id="fig16"></a>
<img src="images/fig16.jpg" width="470" height="278" alt="" />
<div><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;16.</span> Effect of cloud. Dotted up-curve indicates responsive fall, and
continuous down-line exhibits slow recovery. First four responses normal; next
three show depression due to diminution of light brought on by cloud, the duration of
which is indicated by horizontal line below. Last three records show restoration
of ex­cit­abil­ity brought on by clearing of sky. All records read from left to right.</div>
</div>

<p>I have frequently noticed that a depression of ex­cit­abil­ity
occurred when the sky was darkened by passing
clouds. This is clearly seen in the above records
obtained with the Resonant Recorder. Uniform sub-maximal<span class="pagenum" title="53"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>
stimuli had been applied to a specimen of <i>Mimosa</i> at
intervals of fifteen minutes. The dotted up-line represents
the responsive fall, and the continuous down-line,
the slow recovery. The first four are the normal uniform
responses (Fig.&nbsp;16). The next three show the depressing
effect of relative darkness due to cloudy weather.
The sky cleared after forty-five minutes, and we notice
the consequent restoration of normal ex­cit­abil­ity.</p>

<p><i>Effect of sudden darkness and its continuation. Experiment
14.</i>&mdash;In the next record (Fig.&nbsp;17) is shown the
immediate and continued action of darkness. The first
two are the normal uniform responses in light. By means
of screens, the plant was next subjected to sudden darkness;
this brought about a marked depression of ex­cit­abil­ity.
Subjection to sudden darkness thus acts as a
stimulus inducing a marked but transient fall of ex­cit­abil­ity.
Under the continuous action of darkness, however,
the ex­cit­abil­ity is at first restored and then undergoes
a persistent depression.</p>

<p><i>Effect of transition from darkness to light: Experiment
15.</i>&mdash;Here we have to deal first with the immediate effect
of sudden transition, and then with the persistent effect of
continuous light. In the record given in Fig.&nbsp;18 the plant
had been kept in the dark and the responses taken in
the usual manner. It was then subjected to light; the
sudden change from darkness to light acted as a stimulus,
inducing a transient depression of ex­cit­abil­ity. In this
connection it is interesting to note that Godlewski found
that in the phenomenon of growth, transition from darkness
to light acted as a stimulus, causing a transient
decrease in the normal rate. The effect of continued light
on <i>Mimosa</i> is an enhancement of ex­cit­abil­ity.</p>

</div>


<h4>EFFECT OF EXCESSIVE TURGOR.</h4>

<p>I have often found that the moto-ex­cit­abil­ity is depressed
under excessive turgor. Thus the “over-turgid” leaf of
<i>Biophytum sensitivum</i> does not exhibit any mechanical
response on rainy days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="55"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a id="fig19"></a>
<img src="images/fig19.jpg" width="450" height="253" alt="" />
<div><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;19.</span> Effect of enhanced turgor, artificially induced. First two responses
normal. Application of water, at arrow, induces depression of moto-ex­cit­abil­ity.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Experiment 16.</i>&mdash;The effect of excessive turgor on moto-ex­cit­abil­ity
may be demonstrated in the case of <i>Mimosa</i>
by allowing its main pulvinus to absorb water. The result
is seen in the above record (Fig.&nbsp;19), where water was
applied on the pulvinus after the second response. It is
seen how a depression of moto-ex­cit­abil­ity results from
excessive turgor brought on by absorption of water. In
such cases, however, the plant is found to accommodate itself
to the abnormal condition and gradually regain its normal
ex­cit­abil­ity in the course of one or two hours.</p>


<h4>INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE.</h4>

<p>The moto-ex­cit­abil­ity of the pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i> is
greatly modified under the influence of temperature. For
the purpose of this in­ves­ti­ga­tion I enclosed the plant in
a glass chamber, raising the temperature to the desired
degree by means of electric heating. Responses to identical
stimuli were then taken at different temperatures. It
was found that the effect of heightened temperature, up
to an optimum, was to enhance the amplitude of response.<span class="pagenum" title="56"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>
Thus with a given specimen it was found that while at
22°C. the amplitude of response was 2.5&nbsp;mm., it became
22&nbsp;mm. at 27°C., and 52&nbsp;mm. at 32°C. The ex­cit­abil­ity
is enhanced under rising, and depressed under falling
temperature. The moto-ex­cit­abil­ity of <i>Mimosa</i> is practically
abolished at the minimum temperature of about 19°C.</p>

<div><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;20.</span> Effect of moderate cooling during a period shown by horizontal
line below. Moderate depression followed by quick restoration.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Effect of lowering of temperature: Experiment 17.</i>&mdash;A
simple way of exhibit­ing the effect of lowering of temperature
is by artificial cooling of the pulvinus. This cannot
very well be done by application of a stream of cooled
water, because, as we have seen, absorption of water by
the pulvinus is attended by a loss of ex­cit­abil­ity: diluted
glycerine has, however, no such drawback. This fluid at
ordinary temperature was first applied on the pulvinus,
and after an interval of half an hour records were taken
in the usual manner. Cooled glycerine was then applied
and the record taken once more; the results are seen in<span class="pagenum" title="57"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>
Figs. 20 and 21. In the former, the first response was
normal at the temperature of the room, which was 32°C.;
the next two exhibit depression of ex­cit­abil­ity under
moderate cooling; the duration of application of moderately
cooled glycerine is there indicated by the horizontal line
below. On the cessation of application, the normal temperature
was quickly restored, with the restoration of
normal ex­cit­abil­ity.</p>

<p>In the next record (Fig.&nbsp;21) is shown the effect of a
more intense cold. It will be noticed that the first effect
was a depression, and subsequently, a complete abolition
of ex­cit­abil­ity. Thick dots in the record represent applications
of stimulus which proved ineffective. It will also
be noticed that even on the cessation of cooling, and the
return of the tissue to normal temperature the induced
abolition of ex­cit­abil­ity persisted as an after-effect for a
considerable time. I have likewise found that the after-effect
of cold in abolishing the conduction of excitation<span class="pagenum" title="58"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>
is also very persistent. These experiments show that owing
to physio­logic­al inertia, the variations of ex­cit­abil­ity in
the plant often lag considerably behind the external changes
which induce them.</p>

<div><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;21.</span> Effect of application of more intense cold. Note sudden depression
followed by abolition of ex­cit­abil­ity, also persistent after-effect.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Effect of high temperature: Experiment 18</i>.&mdash;It has been
shown that the moto-ex­cit­abil­ity is enhanced by rising
temperature; there is, however, an optimum temperature
above which the ex­cit­abil­ity undergoes a depression. This
is seen in the following record (Fig.&nbsp;22), where the
normal response at 32°C. was depressed on raising the
temperature to 42°C.; the ex­cit­abil­ity was, however,
gradually restored when the plant was allowed to regain
the former temperature.</p>

<div><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;22.</span> Effect of temperature above optimum. Note depression of ex­cit­abil­ity
induced by high temperature, and gradual restoration on return to normal.</div>
</div>

<p>I may now briefly recapitulate some of the important
results: darkness depresses and light exalts the moto-ex­cit­abil­ity.
Excessive turgor depresses motility. Still more
marked is the effect of temperature. Lowering of temperature
depresses and finally abolishes the moto-ex­cit­abil­ity: rise of
temperature enhances it up to an optimum temperature, but<span class="pagenum" title="59"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>
beyond this point the ex­cit­abil­ity undergoes depression. <i>The
change in ex­cit­abil­ity induced by the variation of external
condition is not immediate; the induced effect, generally
speaking, lags behind the inducing cause.</i></p>


<h4>DIURNAL VARIATION OF EXCITABILITY.</h4>

<p>I will now give automatic records of responses taken
once every hour for twenty-four hours. They prove conclusively
the diurnal variation of ex­cit­abil­ity in <i>Mimosa</i>.
After studying in detail the variations char­ac­ter­is­tic of
particular times of the day, I will endeavour to correlate
them with the effects brought on by the periodic changes
of the environment.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 19.</i>&mdash;As a typical example I will first give
a record obtained in the month of February, that is, say,
in spring. From this it will not be difficult to follow
the variations which take place earlier in winter or later
in summer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 590px;">
<a id="fig23"></a>
<img src="images/fig23.jpg" width="590" height="294" alt="" />
<div><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;23.</span> Record for twenty-four hours, exhibit­ing diurnal variation of ex­cit­abil­ity (spring specimen). The displacement of
base-line is due to nyctitropic movement.</div>
</div>

<p>The record given in Fig.&nbsp;23 was commenced at 5 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>
and continued to the same hour next day. The first thing
noticeable is the periodic displacement of the base-line.
This is due to the nyctitropic movements of the leaf. It
should be remembered that the up-movement of the leaf
is represented by down-curve, and <i>vice versâ</i>. After the
maximum fall of the leaf, which in this case was attained
at 9 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>, there followed a reverse movement: the highest
erection, indicative of maximum turgor, was reached at
6 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span> The leaf then fell slowly and reached a middle
position at noon. The extent of the nyctitropic movement
varies in individual cases; in some it is slight, in others
very large. The erectile movement began, as stated before,
at about 9 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>; in some cases, however, it may occur as
early as 6 <span class="pagenum" title="60"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span><span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p>In following the char­ac­ter­is­tic variations of response
occurring throughout the day, we find that while they<span class="pagenum" title="61"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span>
are practically uniform between the hours of 5 and
6 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>, a continuous decline is manifested after setting in
of darkness (7 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>); the fall of ex­cit­abil­ity continues
even after sunrise (6-30 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span>), response being practically
abolished at 8 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span> The ex­cit­abil­ity is then gradually
restored in a staircase manner, the maximum being
reached after 12 noon. After attaining this, the ex­cit­abil­ity
remains more or less constant till the evening. It will be
noticed that the amplitude of response at 5 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span> on the
second day was the same as the corresponding response
on the previous day.</p>

<p>The results of this and numerous other records taken
in spring may be summarized <span class="nowrap">as:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="pl3hi">1. The maximum ex­cit­abil­ity of <i>Mimosa</i> is attained
between 1 and 3 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>, and remains constant
for several hours. In connection with the constancy
of response at this period, it should be
remembered that when the response is at its
maximum a slight increase of ex­cit­abil­ity cannot
further enhance the amplitude of response.</p>

<p class="pl3hi">2. The ex­cit­abil­ity, generally speaking, undergoes a
continuous decline from evening to morning,
the response being practically abolished at or
about 8 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span></p>

<p class="pl3hi">3. From 8 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span> to 12 noon, the ex­cit­abil­ity is gradually
enhanced in a staircase manner, till the
maximum ex­cit­abil­ity is reached after 1 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p>I have obtained numerous records in support of these
conclusions, some of which are reproduced in the following
figures. In these cases responses to uniform stimuli
at intervals of half an hour were taken at different parts
of the day, the recorder employed being of the Resonant
type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="62"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Mid-day record: Experiment 20.</i>&mdash;The record of daily
periodicity previously given shows that the ex­cit­abil­ity
reaches its maximum after 12 noon, and that it remains
constant at the maximum value for several hours. This
fact is fully borne out in the following record obtained
with a different specimen (Fig.&nbsp;24). The responses were
taken here from noon to 3 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>, once every half-hour.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 452px;">

<div><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;24.</span> Mid-day record from noon to 3 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span> exhibit­ing uniform ex­cit­abil­ity.
Responses taken once every half-hour.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Evening record: Experiment 21.</i>&mdash;The record given in
<a href="#fig23">Fig.&nbsp;23</a> shows that the amplitude of response falls continuously
after 6 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span> It might be thought that the
diminished amplitude in the first part may be due to the
natural nyctitropic fall of the leaf. The range of the
pulvinar movement being limited, it is clear that the
extent of the responsive fall must become smaller on
account of the natural fall of the leaf during the first
part of the night. That this is not the whole explanation
of the decline of response in the evening will be clear
from certain facts which I will presently adduce. It was
stated that the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i> exhibits nyctitropic fall<span class="pagenum" title="63"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>
from 6 to 9 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>, after which there is a reverse movement
of erection. In certain specimens, however, the
erectile movement commenced as early as 6 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span> It is
obvious that in these latter cases diminution of amplitude
of response cannot be due to the reduction of the range
of movement of the leaf. In Fig.&nbsp;25 is given a series of
records from 6 to 10 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span> obtained with a leaf in which
erectile movement had commenced early in the evening.
Though the full range of responsive movement was in
this case available, yet the amplitude of successive responses
is seen to undergo continuous diminution.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Record in the morning: Experiment 22.</i>&mdash;The ex­cit­abil­ity
is, as we have seen, nearly abolished about 8 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span>,
after which there is a gradual restoration. This gradual
enhancement of ex­cit­abil­ity to a maximum in the course<span class="pagenum" title="64"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>
of the forenoon is seen well illustrated in the
record below (Fig.&nbsp;26).</p>

<p>The record of daily periodicity given in <a href="#fig23">Fig.&nbsp;23</a> may
be regarded as a typical example. Modi­fi­ca­tions may,
however, be observed which are traceable to individual
peculiarities. As an example of this, I give a record
(<a href="#fig27">Fig.&nbsp;27</a>) obtained with a specimen in which nyctitropic
movement was very pronounced. The periodic variation
of ex­cit­abil­ity exhibited here is practically the same as
shown by other specimens. The interesting variation is in
the character of the recovery from stimulus; the leaf
was falling from 6 to 9 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>; owing to the shifting of
the base-line upwards the recovery appears to be incomplete.
After 9 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span> the leaf was erected, at first slowly,
then at a very rapid rate. The consequent fall of the
base-line late at night is very abrupt; hence there is an<span class="pagenum" title="65"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span>
apparent over-shooting in the line of recovery.</p>

<h4>EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON VARIATION OF EXCITABILITY.</h4>

<p>So far I have merely described the observed diurnal
variation of ex­cit­abil­ity. We may next inquire whether<span class="pagenum" title="66"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>
there is any causal relation between the change of external
conditions and the observed variation of ex­cit­abil­ity.
It has been shown that the moto-ex­cit­abil­ity is greatly
influenced by temperature. In order to find in what manner
the diurnal variation of ex­cit­abil­ity was influenced by
the daily variation of temperature, I took special care to
secure by means of the thermograph a continuous record
of temperature variations. The table which follows shows
the relation between the hours of the day, temperature,
and amplitude of response, in a typical case of diurnal
variation of ex­cit­abil­ity.</p>

<h4>EFFECT OF PHYSIOLOGICAL INERTIA.</h4>

<p>It has been shown (<a href="#Page_59">page 59</a>) that owing to physio­logic­al
inertia, the change of ex­cit­abil­ity, generally speaking, lags
behind the inducing cause. This fact finds striking illustration
in the lag exhibited by the curve of ex­cit­abil­ity in
reference to the temperature curve. The minimum temperature
was attained at about 4 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span>, but the ex­cit­abil­ity
was not reduced to a minimum till four hours later and
again there is a marked fall of temperature after 5 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>,
but the ex­cit­abil­ity did not become depressed till two hours
later.</p>

<p>There is again the factor of variation of light, the effect
of which is not so great as that of temperature. The
periods of maximum of light and temperature are, however,
not coincident.</p>

<p>We may now discuss in greater detail the diurnal variation
of ex­cit­abil­ity in <i>Mimosa</i>, taking the typical case, the
record of which is given in <a href="#fig23">Fig.&nbsp;23</a>. The temperature here
is seen to remain almost constant, and at an optimum, from
1 to 5 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>, the condition of light is also favourable. Hence
the ex­cit­abil­ity is found to be constant, and at its maximum
between these hours. The temperature begins to fall
after 6 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>, and there is, in addition, the depressing
action of gathering darkness. Owing to the time-lag,
the fall of ex­cit­abil­ity does not commence immediately
at 6 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>, but an hour afterwards, and continues
till the next morning. During this period we have the
cumulative effect of twelve hours’ darkness and the<span class="pagenum" title="69"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>
increasing depression due to cold, the temperature minimum
occurring at 4 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span> On account of the combined effects
of these various factors, and phenomenon of lag, the period
of minimum ex­cit­abil­ity is in general reached about 8 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span>
In certain other cases this may occur earlier. After the
attainment of this minimum, the ex­cit­abil­ity is gradually
and continuously increased, under the action of light and
of rising temperature, till the maximum is reached in the
afternoon.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF SEASON.</h4>

<p>It was said that temperature exerted a predominant
influence in inducing variation of ex­cit­abil­ity. We may,
therefore, expect that the diurnal period would be modified
in a certain way according to the season. In winter the
night temperature falls very low; hence the depression of
ex­cit­abil­ity is correspondingly great, and results in the
complete abolition of ex­cit­abil­ity. The after-effect of intense
cold is seen in the condition of inexcitability persisting
for a very long period in the morning. In summer the
prevailing high temperature modifies the diurnal periodicity
in a different manner. When the night is warm, the fall
of ex­cit­abil­ity is slight. In the day, on the other hand,
the temperature may rise above the optimum, bringing
about a depression. In such a case the ex­cit­abil­ity in the
earlier part of the evening may actually be greater than
in the middle of the day. These modi­fi­ca­tions are shown
in a very interesting way in the following record (Fig.&nbsp;29)
taken at the end of April. The temperature of Calcutta
at this season often rises above 100°F. or 38°C. Table III
also exhibits, in the case of the summer specimen, the
relation between the hours of the day, temperature, and
ex­cit­abil­ity.</p>

<div><p class="tac"><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;29.</span> Diurnal variation of ex­cit­abil­ity exhibited by summer specimen.</p></div>
</div>

<p>An inspection of the record given in Fig.&nbsp;29 shows that
the amplitude of response was enhanced after 4 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span> The
temperature up to that time was unusually high (38°C.),
and there was in consequence a depression of ex­cit­abil­ity.
After that hour there was a mitigation of heat, the
temperature returning towards the optimum. Hence we
find that the maximum ex­cit­abil­ity was attained between
the hours 4 and 6 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span> The minimum temperature at
night was higher in the present case than that of the
experiment carried out in February; in the former the
minimum was 25.5°C., while in the latter it was 19.5°C.
On account of this difference the night record in summer
shows a fall of ex­cit­abil­ity which is far more gradual than
that obtained in spring. The ex­cit­abil­ity is here not
totally abolished in the morning, but reaches a minimum<span class="pagenum" title="71"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>
after 8 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span>; the sensitiveness is then gradually enhanced
in a staircase manner.</p>

<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The moto-ex­cit­abil­ity of <i>Mimosa</i> was gauged every hour
of the day and night, by the amplitude of the response
to a testing stimulus. This is effected by means of automatic
devices which excite the plant periodically by an
absolutely constant stimulus, and record the corresponding
mechanical response.</p>

<p>From the record thus obtained, it was found that the
ex­cit­abil­ity of the plant is not the same throughout the
day, but undergoes a variation char­ac­ter­is­tic­al­ly different
at different times of the day. In a typical case in spring<span class="pagenum" title="72"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span>
the ex­cit­abil­ity attained its maximum value after 1 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span> and
remained constant for several hours. There was then a
continuous fall of ex­cit­abil­ity, the minimum being reached
at about eight in the morning. The plant at this time
was practically insensitive. The moto-ex­cit­abil­ity was then
gradually enhanced in a staircase manner till it again
reached a maximum next afternoon.</p>

<p>The effect of sudden darkness was found to induce a
transient depression, followed by revival of ex­cit­abil­ity.
The effect of persistent darkness was to induce a
depression.</p>

<p>Exposure to light from darkness caused a transient
depression, followed by an enhancement of ex­cit­abil­ity.</p>

<p>Excessive turgor induced a diminished response.</p>

<p>Lowering of temperature induced a depression of ex­cit­abil­ity,
culminating in an abolition of response. The after-effect
of excessive cold was a prolonged depression of
ex­cit­abil­ity.</p>

<p>Excitability was enhanced by rising temperature up to
an optimum; above this point a depression was induced.</p>

<p>Owing to physio­logic­al inertia the change of ex­cit­abil­ity
induced by variation of external condition lags
behind the inducing cause.</p>

<p>The diurnal variation of ex­cit­abil­ity is primarily due
to diurnal variation of temperature. The effect is modified
in a minor degree by variation of light.</p>

<h3>V.&mdash;RESPONSE OF PETIOLE-PULVINUS PREPARATION OF <i>MIMOSA PUDICA</i></h3>

<p>The most suitable plant for researches on irritability of
plants is <i>Mimosa pudica</i>, which can be obtained in all
parts of the world. An impression unfortunately prevails
that the excitatory reaction of the plant can be obtained
only in summer and under favourable circumstances; this
has militated against its extensive use in physio­logic­al
experiments, but the misgiving is without any foundation;
for I found no difficulty in demonstrating even the most
delicate experiments on <i>Mimosa</i> before the meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science held
during Christmas of 1914. The prevailing outside temperature
at the time was considerably below the freezing
point. With foresight and care it should not be at all
difficult to maintain in a hot-house a large number of
these plants in a sensitive condition all the year
round.</p>

<p>In order to remove the drawback connected with the
supply of sufficient material, I commenced an in­ves­ti­ga­tion
to find whether a detached leaf preparation could be made
as effective for the study of irritability as the whole plant.<span class="pagenum" title="74"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span>
Here we have at the central end of the leaf the pulvinus,
which acts as the contractile organ; the conduct­ing strand
in the interior of the petiole, on the other hand, is the
vehicle for trans­mission of excitation. The problem to
be solved is the rendering of an isolated petiole-and-pulvinus
of <i>Mimosa</i> as efficient for researches on irritability
as the nerve-and-muscle preparation of a frog. On the
success of this attempt depended the practical opening out
of an extended field of physio­logic­al in­ves­ti­ga­tion which
would be unhampered by any scarcity of experimental
material.</p>

<p>In connection with this it is well to note the surprising
difference in vegetative growth as exhibited by plants
grown in soil and in pots. A pot-specimen of <i>Mimosa</i>
produces relatively few leaves, but one grown in the open
ground is extremely luxuriant. As an instance in point, I
may state that for the last five months I have taken
from a plant grown in a field about 20 leaves a day for
experiment, without making any impression on it. A large
box containing soil would be practically as good as the
open ground, and the slower rate of growth in a colder
climate could be easily made up by planting half a dozen
specimens. The protection of the plants from inclemencies
of weather can be ensured by means of a glass cover
with simple heat-regulation by electric lamps, in place of
an expensive green-house.</p>

<p>Returning to the question of the employment of an
isolated leaf, which I shall designate as a petiole-pulvinus
preparation, instead of the entire plant, the first attempts
which I made proved unsuccessful. The cut leaf kept in
water would sometimes exhibit very feeble response, at
other times all signs of ex­cit­abil­ity appeared to be totally
abolished. It was impossible to attempt an in­ves­ti­ga­tion on
the effect of changing environment on ex­cit­abil­ity when the
normal sensitiveness itself underwent so capricious a change</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="75"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span></p>

<p>These difficulties were ultimately overcome from knowledge
derived through systematic in­ves­ti­ga­tion on the
relative importance of the different parts of the motor
apparatus, on the immediate and after-effect of section on
the ex­cit­abil­ity of the leaf, and on the rate of decay of
this ex­cit­abil­ity on isolation from the plant. The experience
thus gained enabled me to secure long-continued and
uniform sensibility under normal conditions. It was thus
possible to study the physio­logic­al effects of changing
external conditions by observing the responsive variation
in the isolated petiole-pulvinus preparation. I propose to
deal with the different aspects of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion in the
following <span class="nowrap">order:&mdash;</span></p>


<p class="pl3hi">1. The effect of wound or section in modi­fi­ca­tion of
normal ex­cit­abil­ity.</p>

<p class="pl3hi">2. The change of ex­cit­abil­ity after immersion in water.</p>

<p class="pl3hi">3. Quantitative determination of the rate of decay of
ex­cit­abil­ity in an isolated preparation.</p>

<p class="pl3hi">4. Effect of amputation of the upper half of pulvinus.</p>

<p class="pl3hi">5. Effect of removal of the lower half.</p>

<p class="pl3hi">6. Influence of the weight of leaf on rapidity of
responsive fall.</p>

<p class="pl3hi">7. The action of chemical agents.</p>

<p class="pl3hi">8. Effect of “fatigue” on response.</p>

<p class="pl3hi">9. The influence of constant electric current on
recovery.</p>

<p class="pl3hi">10. The action of light and darkness on ex­cit­abil­ity.</p>

<p>The isolated petiole-pulvinus preparation is made by
cutting out a portion of the stem bearing a single lateral
leaf. The four diverging sub-petioles may also be cut off.
In order to prevent rapid drying the specimen has to be
kept in water. Preparations made in this way often
appeared to have lost their sensibility. I was, however,
able to trace this loss to two different factors: first, to<span class="pagenum" title="76"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>
the physio­logic­al depression due to injury caused by section,
and, second, to the sudden increase of turgor brought on
by excessive absorption of water. I shall now proceed to
show that the loss of sensibility is not permanent, but is
capable of restoration.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF WOUND OR SECTION IN MODIFICATION OF
NORMAL EXCITABILITY.</h4>

<p>In connection with the question of effect of injury, it
is to be borne in mind that after each excitation the
plant becomes temporarily irresponsive and that the ex­cit­abil­ity
is fully restored after the completion of protoplasmic
recovery. A cut or a section acts as a very intense
stimulus, from the effect of which the recovery is very
slow. If the stem be cut very near the leaf, the excitation
of the pulvinus is very intense, and the consequent
loss of ex­cit­abil­ity becomes more or less persistent. But
if the stem be cut at a greater distance, the transmitted
excitation is less intense, and the cut specimen recovers
its ex­cit­abil­ity within a moderate time. I have also succeeded
in reducing the excitatory depression by previously
benumbing the tissue by physio­logic­al means. The isolated
specimen can be made still more compact by cutting off
the sub-petioles bearing the leaflets; the preparation now
consists of a short length of stem of about 2&nbsp;cm. and
an equally short length of primary petiole, the motile
pulvinus being at the junction of the two.</p>

<div><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;30</span>&mdash;The Resonant Recorder, with petiole-pulvinus prep­ar­ation. (From a
photograph.)</div>
</div>

<p>For the restoration of sensitiveness, and to meet working
conditions, the lower end of the cut stem is mounted
on a <b>T</b>-tube, with funnel-attachment and exit-tube, as
shown in Fig.&nbsp;30. The other two cut ends&mdash;of the stem
and of the petiole&mdash;may be covered with moist cloth or
may be closed with collodion flexile to prevent rapid
evaporation and drying up of the specimen. A slight<span class="pagenum" title="77"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span>
hydrostatic pressure maintains the specimen in a moderately
turgid condition. A preparation thus made is
insensitive at the beginning, but if left undisturbed it
slowly recovers its ex­cit­abil­ity. The history of the depression
of ex­cit­abil­ity after shock of preparation and its<span class="pagenum" title="78"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span>
gradual restoration is graphically illustrated by a series of
records made by the plant (<a href="#fig31">Fig.&nbsp;31</a>).</p>

<p>The petiole-pulvinus preparation thus made offers all
facilities for experiment. Owing to its small size it can
be easily manipulated; it can be enclosed in a small
chamber and subjected to varying conditions of temperature
and to the action of different vapours and gases. Drugs
are easily absorbed at the cut end, and poison and its
antidote can be successively applied through the funnel
without any disturbance of the continuity of record. In
fact, many experiments which would be impossible with the
entire plant are quite practicable with the isolated leaf.</p>

<p>The arrangement for taking records of response is seen
in <a href="#fig30">Fig.&nbsp;30</a>, which is reproduced from a photograph of the
actual apparatus. For recording the response and recovery
of the leaf under stimulation, I use my Resonant Recorder
fully described in the ‘Philosophical Transactions’ (1913).
The petiole is attached to one arm of the horizontal lever.
The writer, made of fine steel wire with a bent tip, is
at right angles to the lever, and is maintained by electro­magnetic
means in a state of to-and-fro vibration, say, ten
times in a second. The record, consisting of a series of
dots, is free from errors arising from friction of continuous
contact of the writer with the recording surface. The successive
dots in the record at definite intervals of a tenth of
a second also give the time-relations of the response curve.</p>

<p>On account of its small size, the petiole-pulvinus preparation
offers great facilities for mounting in different ways
suitable for special in­ves­ti­ga­tions. Ordinarily, the cut stem
with its lower end enclosed in moist cloth is supported
below. A very suitable form of stimulus is that of induction
shock from a secondary coil, the intensity of which is
capable of variation in the usual manner by adjusting the
distance between the primary and the secondary coils. The<span class="pagenum" title="79"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>
motile pulvinus, P, may be excited directly. For in­ves­ti­ga­tions
on velocity of trans­mission of excitation, stimulus is
applied on the petiole at some distance from the pulvinus,
by means of suitable electrodes. Excitation is now transmitted
along the intervening length of petiole, the conduct­ing
power of which will be found appropriately modified
under the action of chemical and other agents. In this
normal method of mounting, the more excitable lower half
of the pulvinus is below; excitatory reaction produces the
fall of the petiole, gravity helping the movement. The preparation
may, however, be mounted in the inverted position,
with the more excitable lower half of the pulvinus facing
upwards. The excitatory movement will now be the erection
of the petiole, against gravity.</p>

<p>Under natural conditions the stem is fixed, and it is the
petiole which moves under excitation. But a very interesting
case presents itself when the petiole is fixed and the
stem free. Here is presented the unusual spectacle of the
plant or the stem “wagging” in response to excitation.</p>


<h4>THE CHANGE OF EXCITABILITY AFTER IMMERSION IN
WATER.</h4>

<p>The isolated specimen can be kept alive for several days
immersed in water. The ex­cit­abil­ity of the pulvinus, however,
undergoes great depression, or even abolition, by the
sudden change of turgor brought on by excessive absorption
of water. The plant gradually accommodates itself to the
changed condition, and the ex­cit­abil­ity is restored in a staircase
manner from zero to a maximum.</p>

<p>In studying the action of a chemical solution on ex­cit­abil­ity,
the solution may be applied through the cut end or
directly on the pulvinus. The sudden variation of turgor,
due to the liquid, always induces a depression, irrespective<span class="pagenum" title="80"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>
of the stimulating or the depressing action of the drug.
The difficulty may be eliminated by previous long-continued
application of water on the pulvinus and waiting till the
attainment of uniform ex­cit­abil­ity which generally takes
place in the course of about three hours. Subsequent application
of a chemical solution gives rise to char­ac­ter­is­tic
variation in the response.</p>

<p><i>Variation of ex­cit­abil­ity after section: <a id="Experiment_23"></a>Experiment 23.</i>&mdash;In
order to test the history of the change of ex­cit­abil­ity
resulting from the immediate and after-effect of section, I
took an intact plant and fixed the upper half of the stem in
a clamp. The response of a given leaf was now taken to
the stimulus of an induction shock of 0.1 unit intensity, the
unit chosen being that which causes a bare perception of
shock in a human being. The specimen was vigorous and
the response obtained was found to be a maximum. The
stem bearing the leaf was cut at the moment marked in
the record with a cross, and water was applied at the cut
end. The effect of section was to cause the maximum fall
of the leaf, with subsequent recovery. After this, successive
responses to uniform stimuli at intervals of 15 minutes
show, in (1) of <a href="#fig31">Fig.&nbsp;31</a>, that a depression of ex­cit­abil­ity has
been induced owing to the shock caused by section. In
course of an hour, however, the ex­cit­abil­ity had been restored
almost to its original value before the section. This
was the case with a vigorous specimen, but with less
vigorous ones a longer period of about three hours is
required for restoration. In certain other cases the response
after section exhibits alternate fatigue; that is to say, one
response is large and the next feeble, and this alternation<span class="pagenum" title="81"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>
goes on for a length of time. The isolated specimen, generally
speaking, attains a uniform sensibility after a few
hours, which is maintained, with very slight decline under
constant external conditions, for about 24 hours. On the
third day the fall of ex­cit­abil­ity is very rapid, and the
sensibility declines to zero in about 50 hours after isolation<span class="pagenum" title="82"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>
[<a href="#fig31">Fig.&nbsp;31</a> (2)]. We may describe the whole cycle of change
as follows: by the shock of operation the isolated preparation
is rendered insensitive for nearly an hour, the ex­cit­abil­ity
is then gradually restored almost to its normal value
before operation. Under constant external conditions, this
ex­cit­abil­ity remains fairly constant for about 24 hours
after which depression sets in. The rate of fall of ex­cit­abil­ity
becomes very rapid 40 hours after the operation, being
finally abolished after the fiftieth hour. It is probable
that in a colder climate the fall of ex­cit­abil­ity would be
much slower. The most important outcome of this inquiry
is the demonstration of the possibility of obtaining persistent
and uniform sensibility in isolated preparations.
On account of this, not only is the difficulty of supply
of material entirely removed but a very high degree of
accuracy secured for the in­ves­ti­ga­tion itself.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF AMPUTATION OF UPPER HALF OF PULVINUS.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 24.</i>&mdash;The determination of the <i>rôle</i> played
by different parts of the pulvinus in response and recovery
is of much theoretical importance. Our knowledge on this
subject is unfortunately very scanty. The generally accepted
view is that on excitation “the actual downward curvature
of the pulvinus is partly due to a contraction of the
walls of the motor cells consequent upon the decrease of
turgor, but is accentuated by expansion of the insensitive
adaxial half of the pulvinus&mdash;which was strongly compressed
in the unstimulated condition of the organ&mdash;and also by the
weight of the leaf.<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></span> According to Pfeffer, after excitation
of the organ, “the original condition of turgor is gradually
reproduced in the lower half of the pulvinus, which expands,
raising the leaf and producing compression of the<span class="pagenum" title="83"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>
upper half of the pulvinus, which aids in the rapid curvature
of the stimulated pulvinus.<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></span></p>

<p>It was held, then, that the rapidity of the fall of leaf
under stimulus is materially aided (1) by the expansion of
the upper half of the pulvinus, which is normally in a state
of compression, and (2) by the weight of the leaf. So
much for theory. The experimental evidence available
regarding the relative importance of the upper and lower
halves of the pulvinus is not very conclusive. Lindsay
attempted to decide the question by his amputation experiments.
He showed that when the upper half was removed
the leaf carried out the response, but rigor set in when
the lower half was amputated. Pfeffer’s experiments on
the subject, however, contradicted the above results. He
found that “after the upper half of the pulvinus was
carefully removed, no movement was produced by stimulation,
whereas when the lower half is absent a weakened
power of movement is retained.” Pfeffer, however, adds,
“since the operation undoubtedly affects the irritability, it
is impossible to determine from such experiments the
exact part played by the active contraction of the lower
half of the pulvinus.<span class="nowrap">”<a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></span></p>

<p>The cause of uncertainty in this in­ves­ti­ga­tion is twofold.
First, it arises from the unknown change in irritability
consequent on amputation; and, secondly, from absence of
any quantitative standard by which the effect of selective
amputation of the pulvinus may be measured. As regards
the first, I have been able to reduce the depressing action
caused by injury to a minimum by benumbing the tissue
before operation, through local application of cold, and also
allowing the shock-effect to disappear after a rest of several
hours. As regards the physio­logic­al gauge of efficiency of
the motor mechanism, such a measure is afforded by the<span class="pagenum" title="84"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>
relation between a definite testing stimulus and the resulting
response with its time-relations, which is secured by
my Resonant Recorder with the standardised electrical
stimulator.</p>

<div><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;32</span>&mdash;Effect of amputation of upper half of pulvinus. Upper record gives
normal response before amputation, and the lower, response after amputation.
(Successive dots at intervals of 0.1 sec). Apex-time 11 sec, in both.</div>
</div>

<p>In carrying out this in­ves­ti­ga­tion I first took the record
of normal response of an intact leaf on a fast moving
plate. A second record, with the same stimulus, was taken
after the removal of the upper half of the pulvinus, having
taken the necessary precautions that have been described.
Comparison of the two records (Fig.&nbsp;32) shows that the only
difference between them is in the exhibition of slight diminution
of ex­cit­abil­ity due to operation. But, as regards
the latent period and the quickness of attaining maximum
fall, there is no difference between the two records before
and after the amputation of the upper half. The upper
part of the pulvinus is thus seen practically to have little
influence in hastening the fall.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF REMOVAL OF THE LOWER HALF.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 25.</i>&mdash;The shock-effect caused by the amputation
of the lower half was found to be very great, and it required
a long period of rest before the upper half regained
its ex­cit­abil­ity. The excitatory reaction of the upper half<span class="pagenum" title="85"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>
is by contraction, and the response is, therefore, the lifting
of the petiole. Thus, in an intact specimen, excitation
causes antagonistic reactions of the two halves. But the
sensibility of the upper half is very feeble and the rate
of its contractile movement, relatively speaking, very slow.
The record of the response of the upper half of the pulvinus,
seen in Fig.&nbsp;33, was taken with an Oscillating Recorder,
where the successive dots are at intervals of 1 sec.: the
mag­ni­fi­ca­tion employed was about five times greater than
in recording the response of the lower half (<a href="#fig32">Fig.&nbsp;32</a>). The
intensity of stimulus to evoke response had also to be
considerably increased. Taking into account the factors of
mag­ni­fi­ca­tion and the intensity of stimulus for effective response,
the lower half I find to be about 80 times more
sensitive than the upper. Thus, under feeble stimulus the
upper half exerts practically no antagonistic reaction. The<span class="pagenum" title="86"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>
excitatory response of the upper half is also seen to be
very sluggish.</p>

</div>


<h4>INFLUENCE OF THE WEIGHT OF LEAF ON RAPIDITY OF
RESPONSIVE FALL.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 26.</i>&mdash;It is obvious that the mechanical
moment exerted by the weight of the leaf must help its
responsive fall under excitation. But the relative importance
of the factors of active contraction of the lower half
of the pulvinus and of the weight, in the rate of the
responsive down-movement, still remains to be determined.
A satisfactory way of solving the problem would lie in
the study of the characteristics of response-records taken
under three different conditions: (1) When the leaf is helped
in its fall by its weight; (2) when the action of the
weight is eliminated; and (3) when the fall has to be
executed against an equivalent weight. An approximation
to these conditions was made in the following manner.
We may regard the mechanical moment to be principally
due to the weight of the four sub-petioles applied at the
end of the main petiole. In a given case these sub-petioles
were cut off, and their weight found to be 0.5 grm. The
main petiole was now attached to the right arm of the
lever, and three successive records were taken: (1) With
no weight attached to the petiole; (2) with 0.5 grm.
attached to its end; and (3) with 0.5 grm. attached to
left arm of the lever at an equal distance from the fulcrum.
In the first case, the fall due to the excitatory
contraction will practically have little weight to help it; in
the second case, it will be helped by a weight equivalent
to those of the sub-petioles with their attached leaflets; and
in the third case, the fall will be opposed by an equivalent
weight. We find that in these three cases there is very<span class="pagenum" title="87"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>
little difference in the time taken by the leaf to complete
the fall (Fig.&nbsp;34).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 415px;">

<div><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;34.</span>&mdash;Effect of weight on rapidity of fall. N, without action of weight;
W, with weight helping; and A, with weight opposing.</div>
</div>

<p>It has been shown that the presence or absence of the
upper half of the pulvinus makes practically no difference
in the period of fall; it is now seen that the weight
exerts comparatively little effect. We are thus led to
conclude that in determining the rapidity of fall, the factors
of expansive force of the upper half of the pulvinus and
the weight of the leaf are negligible compared to the active
force of contraction exerted by the lower half of the
pulvinus.</p>


<h4>ACTION OF CHEMICAL AGENTS.</h4>

<p>In connection with this subject it need hardly be said
that the various experiments which I had previously carried
out with the intact plant can also be repeated with the
isolated preparation. I will only give here accounts of
experiments which are entirely new.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="88"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span></p>

<p>The chemical solution may be applied directly to the
pulvinus, or it may be absorbed through the cut end, the
absorption being hastened by hydrostatic pressure. The
normal record is taken after observing precautions which
have already been mentioned. The reaction of a given
chemical agent is demonstrated by the changed character
of the record. The effect of the drug is found to depend
not merely on its chemical nature, but also on the dose.
There is another very important factor&mdash;that of the tonic
condition of the tissue&mdash;which is found to modify the
result. The influence of this will be realised from the
account of an experiment to be given presently, where an
identical agent is shown to produce diametrically opposite
effects on two specimens, one of which was in a normal,
and the other in a sub-tonic, condition. The experiments
described below relate to reactions of specimens in a normal
condition.</p>

dilute solution exerts a stimulating action. Normal records,<span class="pagenum" title="89"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>
were taken after long-continued application of water on
the pulvinus. The peroxide, as supplied by Messrs. Parke
Davis &amp; Co., was diluted to 1 per cent., and applied to
the pulvinus; this gave rise to an enhancement of response.
Re-application of water reduced the amplitude to the old
normal value (Fig.&nbsp;35).</p>

<p><i>Barium Chloride: Experiment 28.</i>&mdash;The action of this
agent is very char­ac­ter­is­tic, inducing great sluggishness in
recovery. The preparation had been kept in 1-per cent.
solution of this substance for two hours. After this the
first response to a given test-stimulus was taken; the
response was only moderate, and the recovery incomplete.
The sluggishness was so great that the next stimulation,
represented by a thick dot (Fig.&nbsp;36), was ineffective.
Tetanising electric shock at T, not only brought about
response, but removed for the time being the induced
sluggishness. This is seen in the next two records, which
were taken under the old test-stimulus. There is now an
enhanced response and a complete recovery. Beneficial
effect of tetanisation disappeared, however, on the cessation<span class="pagenum" title="90"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>
of stimulus. This is seen in the next two records which
were taken after two hours. The amplitude of response was
not only diminished, but the recovery also was incomplete.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Antagonistic actions of Alkali and Acid: Experiment
29.</i>&mdash;Alkali and acid are known to exert antagonistic
actions on the spontaneous beat of the heart; dilute solution
of NaOH arrests the beat of the heart in systolic
contraction, while dilute lactic acid arrests the beat in
diastolic expansion. I have found identical antagonistic reactions
in the pulsating tissue of <i>Desmodium gyrans</i>, the
telegraph plant. It is very interesting to find that these
agents also exert their char­ac­ter­is­tic effects on the response
of <i>Mimosa</i> in a manner which is precisely the same. This
is seen illustrated in Fig.&nbsp;37, where the application of
NaOH arrested the response in a contracted state; after
this, the antagonistic effect of dilute lactic acid is seen
first, in its power of restoring the ex­cit­abil­ity; its conti<span class="pagenum" title="91"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>nued
application, however, causes a second arrest, but this
time in a state of relaxed expansion.</p>

<p><i>CuSO<sub>4</sub> Solution.</i>&mdash;This agent acts as a poison, causing a
gradual diminution of amplitude of response, culminating
in actual arrest at death. Certain poisons, again, exhibit
another striking symptom at the moment of death, an
account of which will be given in a separate paper.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF “FATIGUE” ON RESPONSE.</h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 253px;">
<a id="fig38"></a>
<img src="images/fig38.jpg" width="253" height="343" alt="" />
<div><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;38.</span>&mdash;“Fatigue” induced by shorten­ing intervening period of rest.</div>
</div>

<p>With <i>Mimosa</i>, after each excitation the recovery becomes
complete after a resting period of about 15&nbsp;min. With
this interval of rest the successive responses for a given
stimulus are equal, and are at their maximum.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 30.</i>&mdash;When the resting interval is diminished
the recovery becomes incomplete, and there is a<span class="pagenum" title="92"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span>
consequent diminution of amplitude of response. There
is thus an increased fatigue with diminished period of
rest. This is illustrated in Fig.&nbsp;38, where the first two
responses are at intervals of 15&nbsp;min.; the resting interval
was then reduced to 10&nbsp;min., the response undergoing a
marked diminution. Conversely, by increasing the resting
interval, first to 12 and then to 15&nbsp;min., the extent of
fatigue was reduced and then abolished.</p>


<h4>THE INFLUENCE OF CONSTANT ELECTRIC CURRENT ON
RECOVERY.</h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 291px;">

<img src="images/fig39.jpg" width="291" height="258" alt="" />
<div><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 39.&mdash;Action of constant current in removal of fatigue by hastening
recovery; N, curve of response in fatigued specimen; C, after passage of current.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Experiment 31.</i>&mdash;From the above experiment it would
appear that since the incompleteness of recovery induces
fatigue, hastening of recovery would remove it. With this
idea I tried various methods for quickening the recovery
of the excited leaf. The application of a constant electric
current was found to have the desired effect. Two electrodes
for introduction of current were applied, one on
the stem and the other on the petiole, at some distance
from the pulvinus. In order to avoid the excitatory effect
of sudden application, the applied current should be in<span class="pagenum" title="93"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>creased
gradually; this was secured by means of a potentiometer
slide. In my experiment a current having an
intensity of 1.4 micro-ampère was found to be effective.
Responses at intervals of 10&nbsp;min., as we have seen, exhibit
marked fatigue. Two responses were recorded on a fast-moving
plate, N before, and C after, the application of
the current. It will be seen (Fig.&nbsp;39) how the application
of current has, by hastening the recovery, enhanced the
amplitude of response and brought about a diminution
of fatigue. In connection with this, I may state that the
tonic condition is, in general, improved as an after-effect
of the passage of current. This is seen in some cases by
a slight increase in ex­cit­abil­ity; in others, where the responses
had been irregular, the previous passage of a current
tends to make the responses more uniform.</p>


<h4>ACTION OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS ON EXCITABILITY.</h4>

<p>In taking continuous records of responses I was struck
by the marked change of ex­cit­abil­ity exhibited by the intact
plant under variation of light. Thus the appearance of a
cloud was quickly followed by an induced depression, and
its disappearance by an equally quick restoration of ex­cit­abil­ity.
This may be explained on the theory that certain
explosive chemical compounds are built up by the photosynthetic
processes in green leaves, and that the intensity
of response depends on the presence of these compounds.
But the building up of a chemical compound must necessarily
be a slow process, and it is difficult on the above
hypothesis to connect the rapid variation of ex­cit­abil­ity
with the production of a chemical compound, or its cessation,
concomitant with changes in the incident light.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 265px;">

<div><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 40.&mdash;Stimulating action of light, and depressing action of darkness.
Horizontal line below represents period of darkness.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Experiment 32.</i>&mdash;In order to find out whether photo-synthesis
had any effect on ex­cit­abil­ity, I placed an intact
plant in a dark room and obtained from it a long series
of responses under uniform test-stimulus. While this was<span class="pagenum" title="94"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>
being done the green leaflets were alternately subjected to
strong light and to darkness, care being taken that the
pulvinus was shaded all the time. The alternate action
of light and darkness on leaflets induced no variation in
the uniformity of response. This shows that the observed
variation of ex­cit­abil­ity in <i>Mimosa</i> under the alternate
action of light and darkness is not attributable to the
photo-synthetic processes.</p>

<p>I next took a petiole-pulvinus preparation from which
the sub-petioles bearing the leaflets had been cut off, and
placed it in a room illuminated by diffused daylight.
The normal responses were taken, the temperature of the
room being 30°C. The room was darkened by pulling
down the blinds, and records were continued in darkness.
The temperature of the room remained unchanged at 30°C.
It will be seen from records given in Fig.&nbsp;40, that in<span class="pagenum" title="95"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>
darkness there is a great depression of ex­cit­abil­ity. Blinds
were next pulled up and the records now obtained exhibit
the normal ex­cit­abil­ity under light. The sky had by this
time become brighter, and this accounts for the slight
enhancement of ex­cit­abil­ity. This experiment proves
conclusively that light has a direct stimulating action on
the pulvinus, independent of photo-synthesis.<span class="nowrap"><a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></span></p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>On isolation of a petiole-pulvinus preparation, the shock
of operation is found to paralyse its sensibility. After suitable
mounting the ex­cit­abil­ity is restored, and remains
practically uniform for nearly 24 hours. After this a depression
sets in, the rate of fall of ex­cit­abil­ity becomes rapid
40 hours after the operation, sensibility being finally abolished
after the fiftieth hour.</p>

<p>Experiments carried out on the effect of weight, and
the influence of selective amputation of the upper and
lower halves of the pulvinus, show that in determining the
rapidity of fall of leaf, the assumed factors of the expansive
force of the upper half of the pulvinus and the weight of
the leaf are negligible compared to the force of active contraction
exerted by the lower half of the pulvinus. The
ex­cit­abil­ity of the lower half is eighty times greater than
that of the upper.</p>

<p>Chemical agents induce char­ac­ter­is­tic changes in ex­cit­abil­ity.
Hydrogen peroxide acts as a stimulant. Barium
chloride renders the recovery incomplete: but tetanisation
temporarily removes the induced sluggishness. Acids and

with alkali taking place in a contracted, and with acid in
an expanded condition of the pulvinus.</p>

<p>The responses exhibit fatigue when the period of rest is
diminished. The passage of constant current is found to
remove the fatigue.</p>

<h3>VI.&mdash;ON CONDUCTION OF EXCITATION IN PLANTS</h3>

<p class="tac mt1em"><i>By</i></p>

<p class="tac mtb1em"><span class="smcap">Sir J.&nbsp;C. Bose</span>.</p>


<p>The plant <i>Mimosa</i> offers the best material for in­ves­ti­ga­tion
on conduction of excitation. With regard to this
question the prevailing opinion had been that in plants
like <i>Mimosa</i>, there is merely a trans­mission of hydro-mechanical
disturbance and no trans­mission of true excitation
comparable with the animal nerve. I have, however,
been able to show that the trans­mission in the plant
is not a mechanical phenomenon, but a propagation of
excitatory protoplasmic change. This has been proved by
the arrest of conduction by the application of various
physio­logic­al blocks. Thus local application of increasing
cold retards, and finally abolishes the conduct­ing power.
The conduct­ing tissue becomes paralysed for a time as an
after-effect of application of cold; the lost conduct­ing
power may, however, be quickly restored by tetanising
electric shocks. The conduct­ing power of an animal nerve
is arrested by an electrotonic block, the conductivity being
restored on the cessation of the current. I have succeeded
in inducing similar electrotonic block of conduction in
<i>Mimosa</i>. Conductivity of a selective portion of petiole
may also be permanently abolished by local action, of
poisonous solution of potassium cyanide<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="98"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span></p>
<p>Having thus established the physio­logic­al character of
the transmitted impulse in plants I shall now proceed to
give some of the principal results of my earlier and
recent in­ves­ti­ga­tions on the effects of various agencies on
conduction of excitation in plants.</p>

<p>Apart from any question of hydro-mechanical trans­mission,
it is important to distinguish two different modes
of trans­mission of excitation. In a motile tissue contraction
of a cell causes a physical deformation and stimulation
of the neighbouring cell. Examples of this are
furnished by the cardiac muscle of the animal, the pulvinus
of <i>Mimosa</i>, and the stamen of <i>Berberis</i>. This mode
of propagation may better be described as a <i>convection</i>
of excitation.</p>

<p>The <i>conduction</i> of excitation, as in a nerve, is a
different process of trans­mission of protoplasmic change.
The conduct­ing tissue in this case does not itself exhibit
any visible change of form. In the plant the necessary
condition for trans­mission of excitation to a distance is
that the conduct­ing tissue should be possessed of protoplasmic
continuity in a greater or less degree. This
condition is fulfilled by vascular bundles. There being
greater facility of trans­mission along the bundles than
across them, the velocity in the longitudinal direction is
very much greater than in the transverse.</p>

<p>For accurate determination of velocity of trans­mission
the testing stimulus should be quantitative and capable of
repetition. Abnormal high velocity has been observed in
<i>Mimosa</i> by applying crude and drastic methods of stimulation,
by a transverse cut or a burn. This is apt to
give rise to a very strong hydro-dynamic disturbance, which
travelling with great speed, delivers a mechanical blow
on the responding pulvinus. Such hydro-dynamic trans­mission
is not the same as physio­logic­al conduction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="99"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span></p>

<p>In the primary petiole of <i>Mimosa</i> the highest velocity
under electric stimulation I find to be about 30&nbsp;mm.
per second. This velocity is considerably lower than the
velocity in the nerve of higher animals, but higher than
in the lower animals. As an example of the latter,
mention may be made of the velocity of 10&nbsp;mm. per
second in the nerve of <i>Anodon</i> and 1&nbsp;mm. per second in
the nerve of <i>Eledone</i>.</p>


<h4>PREFERENTIAL DIRECTION OF CONDUCTION.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 33.</i>&mdash;The conduction of excitatory impulse
takes place in both directions. This can be demonstrated
by taking a petiole of <i>Biophytum sensitivum</i> or of <i>Averrhoa
carambola</i>. These petioles are provided with a series of
motile leaflets. Stimulation at the middle point of the
petiole gives rise to two waves of excitation, one of which
travels towards the central axis of the plant, and the other
away from it. The centrifugal velocity is greater than
the centripetal as will be seen from the following results:</p>

<h4>EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE.</h4>

<p>Variation of temperature has a marked effect on the
velocity of trans­mission of excitation. Lowering of temperature
diminishes the velocity, culminating in an arrest.
Rise of temperature, on the other hand, enhances the
velocity. This enhancement is considerable in specimens
in which the normal velocity is low, but in plants in
optimum condition, the velocity being already high, cannot<span class="pagenum" title="100"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>
be further enhanced. The following tabular statement
gives results of effects of temperature on velocity of trans­mission
in <i>Mimosa</i> and <i>Biophytum</i><span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

</table></div>


<h4>EFFECT OF SEASON.</h4>

<p>The velocity of trans­mission is very much lower in
winter than in summer. In the petiole of <i>Mimosa</i>, the
velocity in summer is as high as 30&nbsp;mm. per second; in
winter it is reduced to about 4&nbsp;mm. The lowering of
velocity in winter is partly due to the prevailing low temperature
and also to the depressed state of physio­logic­al
activity.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF AGE.</h4>

<p>In a <i>Mimosa</i> plant, different leaves will be found of
different age. Of these the youngest will be at the top.
Lower down, we obtain a fully grown young leaf, and
near the base, leaves which are very old. The in­ves­ti­ga­tion
deals with the effect of age on the conduct­ing power of the
petiole.</p>

<p><i>Comparison of conduct­ing power in different leaves:
Experiment 34.</i>&mdash;Selecting three leaves from the same plant
we apply an identical electric stimulus at points <span class="pagenum" title="101"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>2&nbsp;cm.
from the three responding pulvini. The electric connections
are so made that the same tetanising shock is applied
on the three petioles, very young, fully grown, and very
old. The secondary coil is gradually pushed in till the
leaves exhibit responsive fall. The fully grown leaf was
the first to respond, the velocity of trans­mission being 23 mm.
per second. The secondary coil had to be pushed nearer
the primary through 6&nbsp;cm. before excitation could be
effectively transmitted through the young petiole; for the
oldest leaf still stronger stimulus was necessary, since in this
case the secondary had to be pushed through an additional
distance of 4&nbsp;cm. for effective trans­mission of excitation.
I also determined the relative values of the minimal intensity
of stimulus, effective in causing trans­mission of excitation
in the three cases. Adopting as before the intensity
of electric stimulus which causes bare perception in a
human being as the unit, I find that the effective stimulus
for a fully grown young petiole is 0.3 unit, while the
very young required 2.5 units, and the very old 5 units.
Hence it may be said that the conduct­ing power of a very
young is an eighth, and of the very old one-sixteenth of
the conductivity of the fully grown young specimen.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the conduct­ing power of a
very young petiole is feebler than in a fully grown specimen.
The conduct­ing tissue, it is true, is present, but the
power of conduction has not become fully developed. This
power is, as we shall see later, conferred by the stimulus
of the environment. In a very old specimen the diminution
of conduct­ing power is due to the general physio­logic­al
decline.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF DESICCATION ON CONDUCTING TISSUES.</h4>

<p>I have already shown that trans­mission in the plant
is a process fundamentally similar to that taking place in<span class="pagenum" title="102"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>
the animal nerve; it has also been shown that the effects
of various physical and chemical agents are the same in
the conduct­ing tissues of plant and of animal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 514px;">

<div><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 41&mdash;Action of glycerine in enhancing the speed and intensity of transmitted
excitation. Stimulus applied at the vertical line. Successive dots in record are
at intervals of 0.1 sec.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Effect of application of glycerine: Experiment 35.</i>&mdash;It is
known that desiccation, generally speaking, enhances the
ex­cit­abil­ity of the animal nerve. As glycerine, by absorption
of water, causes partial desiccation, I tried its effect
on conduction of excitation in the petiole of <i>Mimosa</i>.
Enhancement of conduct­ing power may be exhibited in
two ways: first, by an increase of velocity of trans­mission;
and, secondly, by an enhancement of the intensity
of the transmitted excitation, which would give rise to a
greater amplitude of response of the motile indicator. In
Fig.&nbsp;41 are given two records, N, before, and the other after
the application of glycerine on a length of petiole through
which excitation was being transmitted. The time-records
demonstrate conclusively the enhanced rate of trans­mission
after the application of glycerine. The increased intensity
of transmitted excitation is also seen in the enhanced<span class="pagenum" title="103"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>
amplitude of response seen in the more erect curve in the
upper record.</p>


<h4>INFLUENCE OF TONIC CONDITION ON CONDUCTIVITY.</h4>

<p>Different specimens of <i>Mimosa</i> are found to exhibit
differences in physio­logic­al vigour. Some are in an optimum
condition, others in an unfavourable or sub-tonic
condition. I shall now describe certain char­ac­ter­is­tic
differences of conductivity exhibited by tissues in different
conditions.</p>

<p><i>Effect of intensity of stimulus on velocity of trans­mission.</i>&mdash;In
a specimen at optimum condition, the velocity
remains constant under varying intensities of stimulus.
Thus the velocity of trans­mission in a specimen was determined
under a stimulus intensity of 0.5 unit; the next
determination was made with a stimulus of four times the
previous intensity, <i>i.e.</i>, 2 units. In both these cases the
velocity remained constant. But when the specimen is in
a sub-tonic condition, the velocity is found to increase
with the intensity of the stimulus. Thus the velocity
of conduction of a specimen of <i>Mimosa</i> in a sub-tonic
condition was found to be 5.9&nbsp;mm. per second under a
stimulus of 0.5 unit; with the intensity raised to 2.5
units, the velocity was enhanced to 8.3&nbsp;mm. per second.</p>

<p><i>After-effect of stimulus.</i>&mdash;In experimenting with a particular
specimen of <i>Mimosa</i> I found that on account of its
sub-tonic condition, the conduct­ing power of the petiole
was practically absent. Previous stimulation was, however,
found to confer the power of conduction as an after-effect.
It is thus seen that stimulus canalises a path for
conduction.</p>

<p>The effect of excessive stimulus in a specimen in an
optimum condition is to induce a temporary depression of
conductivity; the effect of strong stimulus on a sub-tonic<span class="pagenum" title="104"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span>
specimen is precisely the opposite, namely, an enhancement
of conductivity. I give below accounts of two typical
experiments carried out with petiole-pulvinus preparation
of <i>Mimosa</i>. Excessive stimulation in these cases was caused
by injury.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 353px;">

<img src="images/fig42.jpg" width="353" height="199" alt="" />
<div><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;42.</span>&mdash;Effect of injury, depressing rate of conduction in normal specimen;
(1) record before, and (2) after injury. (Dot-intervals, 0.1 sec.).</div>
</div>


<p><i>Action of Injury on Normal Specimens: Experiment 36.</i>&mdash;A
cut stem with entire leaf was taken, and stimulus applied
at a distance of 15&nbsp;mm. from the pulvinus. From the
normal record (1) in Fig.&nbsp;42 the velocity of trans­mission was
found to be 18.7&nbsp;mm. per sec. The end of the petiole
beyond the point of application of the testing stimulus was
now cut off, and record of velocity of trans­mission
taken once more. It will be seen from record (2) that
the excessive stimulus caused by injury had induced a
depression in the conduct­ing power, the velocity being
reduced to 10.7&nbsp;mm. per sec. Excessive stimulation of
normal specimens is thus seen to depress temporarily the
conduct­ing power.</p>

<p><i>Action of Injury on Sub-tonic Specimens: <a id="Experiment_37"></a>Experiment
37.</i>&mdash;I will now describe a very interesting experiment which
shows how an identical agent may, on account of difference<span class="pagenum" title="105"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>
in the tonic condition of the tissue, give rise to diametrically
opposite effects. In demonstrating this, I took a
specimen in a sub-tonic condition, in which the conduct­ing
power of the tissue was so far below par, that the test-stimulus
applied at a distance of 15&nbsp;mm. failed to be
transmitted (Fig.&nbsp;43). The end of the petiole at a distance
of 1&nbsp;cm. beyond the point of application of test-stimulus
was now cut off. The after-effect of this injury was
found to enhance the conduct­ing power so that the stimulus
previously arrested was now effectively transmitted, the
velocity being 25&nbsp;mm. per sec. This enhanced conduct­ing
power began slowly to decline, and after half an hour
the velocity had declined to 4.1&nbsp;mm. per sec. The end
of the petiole was cut once more, and the effect of injury
was again found to enhance the conduct­ing power, the
velocity of trans­mission being restored to 25&nbsp;mm. per sec.</p>

<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>There are two different types of propagation of excitation:
by convection, and by conduction. In the former the
excited cell undergoes deformation and causes mechanical
stimulation of the next; example of this type is seen in<span class="pagenum" title="106"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>
the stamen of <i>Berberis</i>. The conduction of excitation consists,
on the other hand, of propagation of excitatory
protoplasmic change. The trans­mission in the petiole of
<i>Mimosa</i> is a phenomenon of conduction.</p>

<p>This conduction takes place along vascular elements.
The conductivity is very much greater in the longitudinal
than in the transverse direction.</p>

<p>Rise of temperature enhances, and fall of temperature
lowers, the rate of conduction. Excitation is transmitted
in both directions; the centrifugal velocity is greater than
the centripetal.</p>

<p>Dessication of conduct­ing tissue by glycerine enhances
the conduct­ing power. Local application of cold depresses
or arrests the conduction. Application of poison permanently
abolishes the power of conduction.</p>

<p>Conductivity is modified by the effect of season, being
higher in summer than in winter.</p>

<p>The power of conduction is also modified by age. In
young specimens the conduct­ing power is low, the conductivity
is at its maximum in fully grown organs; but a
decline of conductivity sets in with age.</p>

<p>The tonic condition of a tissue has an influence on
conductivity. In an optimum condition, the velocity is the
same for feeble or strong stimulus. Excessive stimulation
induces a temporary depression of the conduct­ing power.</p>

<p>The effects are different in a sub-tonic tissue: velocity
of trans­mission increases with intensity of stimulus; after-effect
of stimulus is to initiate or enhance the conduct­ing
power. The conduct­ing path is canalised by stimulus.</p>

<h3>VII.&mdash;ON ELECTRIC CONTROL OF EXCITATORY IMPULSE</h3>

<p class="tac mt1em"><i>By</i></p>

<p class="tac mtb1em"><span class="smcap">Sir J.&nbsp;C. Bose.</span></p>


<p>I have in my previous <span class="nowrap">works<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a></span> described in­ves­ti­ga­tions
on the conduction of excitation in <i>Mimosa pudica</i>. It was
there shown that the various characteristics of the propagation
of excitation in the conduct­ing tissue of the plant
are in every way similar to those in the animal nerve.
Hence it appeared probable that any newly found phenomenon
in the one case was likely to lead to discovery of a
similar phenomenon in the other.</p>

<p>As the trans­mission of excitation is a phenomenon of
propagation of molecular disturbance in the conduct­ing
vehicle, it appeared that the excitatory impulse could be
controlled by inducing in the conduct­ing tissue two opposite
‘molecular dispositions’, using that term in the widest
sense. The possibility of accomplishing this by the directive
action of an electric current had attracted my attention for
many years.</p>


<h4>METHOD OF CONDUCTIVITY BALANCE.</h4>

<p>I have previously carried out an electric method of in­ves­ti­ga­tion,
dealing with the influence of electric current
on conductivity. The method of Conductivity Balance which
I devised for this <span class="nowrap">purpose<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a></span> was found very suitable. Isolated
conduct­ing tissues of certain plants were found to exhibit<span class="pagenum" title="108"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>
transmitted effect of excitatory electric change of gal­vano­metric
negativity, which at the favourable season of the
year was of sufficient intensity to be recorded by a sensitive
galvanometer. A long strand of the conduct­ing tissue was
taken and two electric connections were made with a
galvanometer, a few centimetres from the free ends.
Thermal stimulus was applied at the middle, when two
excitatory waves with their concomitant electric changes
were transmitted outwards. By suitably moving the point
of application of stimulus nearer or further away from one
of the two electric contacts, an exact balance was obtained.
This was the case when the resultant galvanometer deflection
was reduced to zero. If now an electrical current be
sent along the length of the conduct­ing tissue, the two
excitatory waves sent outwards from the central stimulated
point will encounter the electric current in different ways;
one of the excitatory waves will travel with, and the other
against the direction of the current. If the power of transmitting
excitation is modified by the direction of an electric current
then the magnitudes of transmitted excitations will be different
in the two cases, with the result of the upsetting of
the Conductivity Balance. From the results of experiments
carried out by this method on the effect of feeble
current on conductivity, the conclusion was arrived at that
<i>excitation is better conducted against the direction of the
current than with it</i>. In other words, the influence of an
electric current is to confer a preferential or selective direction
of conductivity for excitation, the tissue becoming a better
conductor in an electric up-hill direction compared with a
down-hill.</p>

<p>The results were so unexpected that I have for long been
desirous of testing the validity of this conclusion by independent
method of inquiry. I shall presently give full account
of the perfected method, and the various difficulties which
had to be overcome to render it practical. Before doing<span class="pagenum" title="109"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span>
this I shall describe a simple method which I have devised
for demonstrating the principal results.</p>


<h4>CONTROL OF TRANSMITTED EXCITATION IN <span class="smcap"><i>AVERRHOA BILIMBI</i></span>.</h4>

<p>The petiole of <i>Averrhoa bilimbi</i> has a large number of
paired leaflets, which, on excitation, undergo downward
closure. Feeble stimulus is applied at a point in the
petiole, and the trans­mission of excitation is visibly manifested
by the serial fall of the leaflets. The distance to
which the excitation reaches is a measure of normal power
of conduction. Any variation of conductivity, by the
passage of an electric current in one direction or the other
is detected by the enhancement or diminution of the distance
through which excitation is transmitted. I shall
describe the special precautions to be taken in carrying
out this in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 537px;">
<a id="fig44"></a>
<img src="images/fig44.jpg" width="537" height="296" alt="" />
<div><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;44.</span>&mdash;Diagram of experimental arrangement for control of transmitted excitation
in <i>Averrhoa bilimbi</i>. For explanation see text.</div>
</div>

<p>Electric stimulus of induction shock of definite intensity
and duration is supplied at the middle of the petiole at EE′
(Fig.&nbsp;44). The leaflets to the left of E, are not necessary<span class="pagenum" title="110"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span>
for the purpose of this experiment and therefore removed.
The intensity of the induction shock may be varied in the
usual manner by removing the secondary coil nearer or
farther from the primary. The duration of the shock is
always maintained constant. On application of electric
stimulus excitation is transmitted along the petiole, the distance
of trans­mission depending on the intensity of stimulus.
With feeble stimulus two pairs of leaflets may undergo
an excitatory fall; with stronger stimulus the trans­mission
is extended to the end of the petiole, and all the leaflets
exhibit movements of closure. We shall now study the
modifying influence of a constant current on conduction
of excitation. C is an electric cell, R the reversing key
by which the electric current could be sent from right to
left or in the opposite direction. When the current is sent
from right to the left, the excitatory impulse initiated at
EE′ travels against the direction of the current in an
‘up-hill’ direction. When the current is reversed it flows
in the petiole from left to right and the transmitted
impulse travels with the current or in a ‘down-hill’
direction.</p>

<p>Two complications are introduced on the completion of
the electric circuit of the constant current: the first,
is the distributing effect of leakage of the induction
current used for excitation, and second, the polar variation
of excitation induced by the constant current.</p>

<p><i>Leakage of induction current.</i>&mdash;Before completing the
constant current circuit, the alternating induction current
goes only through the path EE′. On completion of the
constant current circuit, the alternating induction current
not only passes through the shorter path EE′ but also by
the circuitous path of the constant current circuit. The
escaping induction current would thus excite all the
leaflets directly and not by its transmitted action.
This difficulty is fully overcome by the interposition of a<span class="pagenum" title="111"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span>
choking coil which will be described below. A simpler,
though less perfect, device may be employed to reduce and
practically eliminate the leakage. This consists of a loop,
L, of silver wire placed outside EE′. The leakage of induction
current is thus diverted along this path of negligible
resistance in preference to the longer circuit through the
entire petiole, which has a resistance of several million ohms.</p>

<p><i>Polar action of current on ex­cit­abil­ity.</i>&mdash;It is well known
that an electric current induces a local depression of ex­cit­abil­ity
at the point of entrance to the tissue, or at the
anode, and an enhancement of ex­cit­abil­ity at the point of
exit, or at the cathode. But the ex­cit­abil­ity is unaffected at
a point equally distant from anode and cathode. This is
known as the indifferent point. The exciting electrodes
EE′ are placed at the indifferent point. But when the
current enters on the right side, the terminal leaflets to the
right have their ex­cit­abil­ity depressed by the proximity of
anode, but the leaflets near the electrodes EE′, being at
a distance from the anode are not affected by it. Moreover
it will be shown that the enhanced conductivity conferred
by the directive action of the current overpowers any
depression of ex­cit­abil­ity in the terminal leaflets due to
the proximity of the anode. I shall, for convenience, designate
the trans­mission as ‘up-hill’, when excitation is
propagated against the direction of the constant electric
current, and ‘down-hill’ when transmitted with the direction
of the current.</p>

<p><i>Transmission of excitation ‘Up-hill’: Experiment 38.</i>&mdash;I
shall give here an account of an experiment which may be
taken as typical. I took a vigorous specimen of <i>Averrhoa
bilimbi</i>, and applied a stimulus whose intensity was so
adjusted that the propagated impulse brought about a fall
of only two pairs of leaflets. This gave a measure of
normal conduction without the passage of the current.
The constant electric current was now sent from right to<span class="pagenum" title="112"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span>
left. A necessary precaution is to increase the current gradually
by means of a suitable potentiometer slide, to its full
value. The reason for this will be given later. The intensity
of the constant current employed was 1.4 micro-ampères.
Now on exciting the petiole by the previous
stimulus, the conduct­ing power was found to be greatly
enhanced. The excitatory impulse now reached the end of
the petiole, and caused six pairs of leaflets to fall.</p>

<p><i>Transmission of excitation ‘Down-hill’: Experiment 39.</i>&mdash;In
continuation of the previous experiment, the constant
electric current was reversed, its directions being now from
left to right. Transmission of excitation was now in a
down-hill direction. On applying the induction shock stimulus
of the same intensity as before, the conduct­ing power
of the petiole was found to be abolished, none of the
leaflets exhibit­ing any sign of excitation. This modi­fi­ca­tion
of the conduct­ing power persists during the passage of the
constant current. On cessation of the current the original
conduct­ing power is found to be restored. It will thus be
seen that the power of conduction is capable of modi­fi­ca­tion,
and that the passage of an electric current of
moderate intensity induces enhanced power of conduction
in an ‘up-hill’ and diminished conductivity in a ‘down-hill’
direction.</p>


<h4>ELECTRIC CONTROL OF NERVOUS IMPULSE IN ANIMALS.</h4>

<p>In my ‘Researches on Irritability of Plants’ I have
shown how intimately connected are the various physio­logic­al
reactions in the plant and in the animal, and I
ventured to predict that the recognition of this unity of
response in plant and animal will lead to further discoveries
in physiology in general. This surmise has been
fully justified, as will be seen in the following experiments
carried out on the nerve-and-muscle preparation of a<span class="pagenum" title="113"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a></span>
frog. It is best to carry out the experiments with vigorous
specimens; this ensures success, even in long continued
experiments, which can then be repeated with unfailing
certainty for hours. It is also an advantage to use a large
frog for its relatively great length of the nerve.</p>

<p><i>Directive action of current on conduction of excitation
in a nerve-and-muscle preparation: Experiment 40.</i>&mdash;A
preparation was made with a length of the spine and two
nerves leading to the muscles. The specimen is supported
in a suitable manner, and electric connections made with
the toes, one for the entrance and the other for exit of
the constant current. The current thus entered, say, by
the left toe ascended the muscle and went up the nerve
on the left side, and descended through the other nerve on
the right side along the muscle and thence to the right
toe. Before the passage of the constant electric current
the spinal nerve was stimulated by an induction shock
of definite intensity. The nervous impulse was conducted
by the two nerves, one to the left and the other to the
right, and caused a feeble twitch of the respective muscles.
A feeble current of 1.5 micro-ampère was sent along the
nerve-and-muscle circuit, ascending by the left and descending
by the right side. It will be seen that excitation
initiated at the spine is propagated ‘against’ the
electric current on the left side, and ‘with’ the current
on the right side. On repetition of previous electric
stimulus the effect of directive action of current
was at once manifested by the left limb being thrown
into a state of strong tetanic contraction, whereas the right
limb remained quiescent. By changing the direction of
the constant current the induced enhancement of conductivity
of the nerve was quickly transferred from the
left to the right side, the depression or arrest of conduction
being simultaneously transferred to the left side.
Turning the reversing key one way or the other brought<span class="pagenum" title="114"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span>
about <i>supra</i> or <i>non</i>-conduct­ing state of the nerve, and
this condition was maintained throughout the duration of
the current.</p>

<p>I shall next describe a more perfect method for obtaining
quantitative results both with plant and animal. In
order to demonstrate the universality of the phenomenon,
I next used <i>Mimosa pudica</i> instead of <i>Averrhoa</i>, for
experiments on plants.</p>

<p>For determination of normal velocity of trans­mission
of excitation and the induced variation of that velocity,
I employed the automatic method of recording the velocity
of trans­mission of excitation in <i>Mimosa</i>, where the excitatory
fall of the motile leaf gave a signal for the arrival
of the excitation initiated at a distant point. In this
method the responding leaf is attached to a light lever,
the writer being placed at right angles to it. The record
is taken on a smoked glass plate, which during its descent
makes an instantaneous electric contact, in consequence
of which a stimulating shock is applied at a given point
of the petiole. A mark in the recording plate indicates
the moment of application of stimulus. After a definite
interval the excitation is conducted to the responding pulvinus,
when the excitatory fall of the leaf pulls the writer
suddenly to the left. From the curve traced in this manner
the time-interval between the application of stimulus and
the initiation of response can be found, and the normal
rate of trans­mission of excitation through a given length
of the conduct­ing tissue deduced. The experiment is then
repeated with an electric current flowing along the petiole
with or against the direction of trans­mission of excitation.
The records thus obtained enable us to determine the
influence of the direction of the current on the rate of
trans­mission. I shall presently describe the various difficulties
which have to be overcome before the method just
indicated can be rendered practical.</p>

<p class="tac fs80">THE METHOD OF EXPERIMENT.</p>

<p>I may here say a few words of the manner in which
the period of trans­mission can be found from the record
given by my Resonant Recorder, fully described in my
previous paper. The writer attached to the recording lever
of this instrument is maintained by electro­magnetic means
in a state of to-and-fro vibration. The record thus consists
of a series of dots made by the tapping writer,
which is tuned to vibrate at a definite rate, say, 10 times
per second. In a particular case whose record is given in
Curve 1 (<a href="#fig46">Fig.&nbsp;46</a>), indirect stimulus of electric shock was
applied at a distance of 15&nbsp;mm. from the responding<span class="pagenum" title="116"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span>
pulvinus. There are 15 intervening dots between the
moment of application of stimulus and the beginning of
response; the time-interval is therefore 1.5 seconds. The
latent period of the motile pulvinus is obtained from a
record of direct stimulation; the average value of this in
summer is 0.1 second. Hence the true period of trans­mission
is 1.4 seconds for a distance of 15&nbsp;mm. The velocity
determined in this particular case is therefore 10.7&nbsp;mm.
per second.</p>

<p>Precaution has to be taken against another source of
disturbance, namely, the excitation caused by the sudden
commencement or the cessation of the constant current. I
have shown <span class="nowrap">elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a></span> that the sudden initiation or cessation
of the current induces an excitatory reaction in the
plant-tissue similar to that in the animal tissue. This
difficulty is removed by the introduction of a sliding
potentiometer, which allows the applied electromotive force
to be gradually increased from zero to the maximum or
decreased from the maximum to zero.</p>

</div>

<p>The experimental arrangement is diagrammatically shown
in Fig.&nbsp;45. After attaching the petiole to the recording
lever, indirect stimulus is applied, generally speaking, at
a distance of 15&nbsp;mm. from the responding pulvinus. Stimulus
of electric shock is applied in the usual manner, by
means of a sliding induction coil. The intensity of the
induction shock is adjusted by gradually changing the
distance between the secondary and the primary, till a
minimally effective stimulus is found. In the study of the
effect of direction of constant current on conductivity, non-polarisable
electrodes make suitable electric connections,
one with the stem and the other with the tip of a sub-petiole
at a distance from each other of about 95&nbsp;mm.
The point of stimulation and the responding pulvinus are
thus situated at a considerable distance from the anode or
the cathode, in the indifferent region in which there is no<span class="pagenum" title="117"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>
polar variation of ex­cit­abil­ity. By means of a Pohl’s commutator
or reverser, the constant current can be maintained
either “with” or “against” the direction of trans­mission
of excitation. The trans­mission in the former case is<span class="pagenum" title="118"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></span>
“down-hill,” and in the latter case “up-hill.” Electrical
connections are so arranged that when the commutator is
tilted to the right, the trans­mission is down-hill, when tilted
to the left, up-hill.</p>

<p>The electrical resistance offered by the 95&nbsp;mm. length
of stem and petiole will be from two to three million ohms.
The intensity of the constant current flowing through the
plant can be read by unplugging the key which short-circuits
the micro-ammeter G. The choking coil C prevents
the alternating induction current from flowing into the
polarising circuit and causing direct stimulation of the
pulvinus.</p>

<p>Before describing the experimental results, it is as well
to enter briefly into the question of the external indication
by which the conduct­ing power may be gauged. Change
of conductivity may be expected to give rise to a variation
in the rate of propagation or to a variation in the magnitude
of the excitatory impulse that is transmitted. Thus
we have several methods at our disposal for determining
the induced variation of conductivity. In the first place
the variation of conductivity may be measured by the induced
change in the velocity of trans­mission of excitation.
In the second place, the transmitted effect of a sub-maximal
stimulus will give rise to enhanced or diminished amplitude
of mechanical response, depending on the increase or
decrease of conductivity brought about by the directive
action of the current. And, finally, the enhancement or
depression of conductivity may be demonstrated by the
ineffectively transmitted stimulus becoming effective, or the
effectively transmitted stimulus becoming ineffective.</p>

<p><i>Exclusion of the factor of Excitability.</i>&mdash;The object of
the enquiry being the pure effect of variation of conductivity,
we have to assure ourselves that under the particular<span class="pagenum" title="119"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span>
conditions of the experiment the complicating factor of
polar variation of ex­cit­abil­ity is eliminated. It is to be
remembered that excitatory trans­mission in <i>Mimosa</i> takes
place by means of a certain conduct­ing strand of tissue
which runs through the stem and the petiole. In the
experiment to be described, the constant current enters by
the tip of the petiole and leaves by the stem, or <i>vice versâ</i>,
the length of the intrapolar region being 95&nbsp;mm. The
point of application of stimulus on the petiole is 40&nbsp;mm.
from the electrode at the tip of the leaf. The responding
pulvinus is also at the same distance from the electrode
on the stem. The point of stimulation and region of response
are thus at the relatively great distance of 40&nbsp;mm.
from either the anode or the cathode, and may therefore be
regarded as situated in the indifferent region. This is
found to be verified in actual experiments.</p>


<h4>EFFECTS OF DIRECTION OF CURRENT ON VELOCITY OF
TRANSMISSION.</h4>

<p>A very convincing method of demonstrating the influence
of electric current on conductivity consists in the
determination of changes induced in the velocity of trans­mission
by the directive action of the current. For this
purpose we have to find out the true time required by the
excitation to travel through a given length of the conduct­ing
tissue (1) in the absence of the current, (2) ‘against’
and (3) ‘with’ the direction of the current. The true time
is obtained by subtracting the latent period of the pulvinus
from the observed interval between the stimulus and response.
Now the latent period may not remain constant,
but undergo change under the action of the polarising
current. It has been shown that the ex­cit­abil­ity of the
pulvinus does not undergo any change when it is situated
in the middle or indifferent region. The following results<span class="pagenum" title="120"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></span>
show that under parallel conditions the latent period also
remains <span class="nowrap">unaffected:&mdash;</span></p>

</table></div>

<p>The results of experiments with two different specimens
given above show that a current applied under the given
conditions has practically no effect on the latent period,
the slight variation being of the order of one-hundredth
part of a second. This is quite negligible when the total
period observed for trans­mission is, as in the following
cases, equal to nearly 2 seconds.</p>

<p><i>Induced changes in the Velocity of Transmission.</i>&mdash;Having
found that the average value of the latent period in summer
is 0.1 second, we next proceed to determine the influence
of the direction of current on velocity.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 41.</i>&mdash;As a rule, stimulus of induction shock was
applied in this and in the following experiments on the petiole
at a distance of 15&nbsp;mm. from the responding pulvinus. The
recording writer was tuned to 10 vibrations per second; the
space between two succeeding dots, therefore, represents a
time-interval of 0.1 second. The middle record, N in <a href="#fig46">Fig.&nbsp;46</a>,
is the normal. There are 17 spaces between the application
of stimulus and the beginning of response. The total time
is therefore 1.7 seconds, and by subtracting from it the latent
period of 0.1 second we obtain the true time, 1.6 seconds.
The normal velocity is found by dividing the distance <span class="pagenum" title="121"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></span>15 mm.
by the true interval 1.6 seconds. Thus V = <span class="nowrap"><span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1 5</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">1.6</span></span></span> =
9.4&nbsp;mm. per second. We shall next consider the effect of
current in modifying the normal velocity. The uppermost
record (1) in Fig.&nbsp;46 was taken under the action of an
‘up-hill,’ or ‘against’ current of the intensity of 1.4 microampères.
It will be seen that the time interval is reduced
from 1.7 seconds to 1.4 seconds; making allowance for the
latent period, the velocity of trans­mission under ‘up-hill’
current V<sub>1</sub> = <span class="nowrap"><span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1 5</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">1.3</span></span></span> = 11.5&nbsp;mm. per second. In the lowest
record (3) we note the effect of ‘down-hill’ current, the
time-interval between stimulus and response being prolonged
to 1.95 seconds and the velocity reduced to 8.1&nbsp;mm. per
second. The conclusion arrived at from this mechanical
mode of in­ves­ti­ga­tion is thus identical with that derived
from the electric method of conductivity balance referred
to previously.</p>

</table></div>

<p>Having demonstrated the effect of direction of current
on the velocity of trans­mission, I shall next describe other
methods by which induced variations of conductivity may
be exhibited.</p>


<h4>DETERMINATION OF VARIATION OF CONDUCTIVITY BY
METHOD OF MINIMAL STIMULUS AND RESPONSE.</h4>

<p>In this method we employ a minimal stimulus, the
transmitted effect of which under normal conditions gives
rise to a feeble response. If the passage of a current
in a given direction enhances conductivity, then the<span class="pagenum" title="123"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>
intensity of transmitted excitation will also be enhanced;
the minimal response will tend to become maximal.
Or excitation which had hitherto been ineffectively transmitted
will now become effectively transmitted. Conversely,
depression of conductivity will result in a diminution
or abolition of response. We may use a single
break-shock of sufficient intensity as the test stimulus. It is,
however, better to employ the additive effect of a definite
number of feeble make-and-break shocks.</p>

<p>We may again employ additive effect of a definite
number of induction shocks, the alternating elements of
which are exactly equal and opposite. This is secured
by causing rapid reversals of the primary current by
means of a rotating commutator. The successive induction
shocks of the secondary coil can thus be rendered exactly
equal and opposite.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 42.</i>&mdash;Working in this way, it is found that
the transmitted excitation against the direction of current
becomes effective or enhanced under ‘up-hill’ current. A
current, flowing with the direction of trans­mission, on the
other hand, diminishes the intensity of transmitted excitation
or blocks it altogether.</p>

<p>Henceforth it would be convenient to distinguish currents
in the two directions: the current in the direction of trans­mission
will be distinguished as <i>Homodromous</i>, and against
the direction of trans­mission as <i>Heterodromous</i>.</p>


<h4>AFTER-EFFECTS OF HOMODROMOUS AND HETERODROMOUS
CURRENTS.</h4>

<p>The passage of a current through a conduct­ing tissue in
a given direction causes, as we have seen, an enhanced
conductivity in an opposite direction. We may suppose this
to be brought about by a particular molecular arrangement<span class="pagenum" title="124"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span>
induced by the current, which assisted the propagation of
the excitatory disturbance in a selected direction. On the
cessation of this inducing force, there may be a rebound
and a temporary reversal of previous molecular arrangement,
with concomitant reversal of the conductivity variation.
The immediate after-effect of a current flowing in a
particular direction on conductivity is likely to be a transient
change, the sign of which would be opposite to that
of the direct effect. The after-effect of a heterodromous
current may thus be a temporary depression, that of a
homo­dromous current, a temporary enhancement of conductivity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 469px;">

current. Next record ↑ shows arrest under homo­dromous current. Last
record ⇡ shows enhancement of conduction greater than normal, as an after-effect
of homo­dromous current. (Dotted arrow indicates the after-effect on
cessation of a given current. ↑ homo­dromous and ↓ hetero­dromous current.)</div>
</div>

<p><i><a id="Experiment_43"></a>Experiment 43.</i>&mdash;This inference will be found fully
justified in the following experiment:&mdash;The first two responses
are normal, after which the hetero­dromous current<span class="pagenum" title="125"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span>
gave rise to an enhanced response. The depressing after-effect
of a hetero­dromous current rendered the next response
ineffective. The following record taken during the
passage of the homo­dromous current exhibited an abolition
of response due to induced depression of conductivity.
Finally, the after-effect of the homo­dromous current is seen
to be a response larger than the normal (Fig.&nbsp;47). These
experiments show that the after-effect of cessation of a
current in a given direction is a transient conductivity
variation, of which the sign is opposite to that induced by
the continuation of the current.</p>


<p class="tac fs80 mt1em">PART II&mdash;INFLUENCE OF DIRECTION OF ELECTRIC CURRENT
ON CONDUCTION OF EXCITATION IN ANIMAL NERVE.</p>

<p>I shall now take up the question whether an electric
current induced any selective variation of conductivity in
the animal nerve, similar to that induced in the conduct­ing
tissue of the plant.</p>


<p class="tac fs80">THE METHOD OF EXPERIMENT.</p>

<p>In the experiments which I am about to describe,
arrangements were specially made so that (1) the excitation
had not to traverse the polar region, and (2) the
point of stimulation was at a relatively great distance
from either pole. The fulfilment of the latter condition
ensured the point of stimulation being placed at the
neutral region.</p>

<p>In the choice of experimental specimens I was fortunate
enough to secure frogs of unusually large size, locally
known as “golden frogs” (<i>Rana tigrina</i>). A preparation
was made of the spine, the attached nerve, the muscle
and the tendon. The electrodes for constant current were
applied at the extreme ends, on the spine and on the<span class="pagenum" title="126"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></span>
tendon (Fig.&nbsp;48). The following are the measurements, in
a typical case, of the different parts of the preparation.
Length of spine between the electrode and the nerve
= 40&nbsp;mm. length of nerve = 90&nbsp;mm. length of muscle =
50&nbsp;mm. length of tendon = 30&nbsp;mm. Stimulus is applied
in all cases on the nerve, midway between the two electrodes
this point being at a minimum distance of 100&nbsp;mm.
from either electrode. The point of stimulation is, therefore,
situated at an indifferent region.</p>

<p>Great precautions have to be taken to guard against
the leakage of current. The general arrangement for the<span class="pagenum" title="127"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></span>
experiment on animal nerve is similar to that employed
for the corresponding in­ves­ti­ga­tions on the plant. The
choking coil is used to prevent the stimulating induction
current from getting round the circuit of constant current.
The specimen is held on an ebonite support, and every
part of the apparatus insulated with the utmost care.</p>


<h4>VARIATION OF VELOCITY OF TRANSMISSION.</h4>

<p>In the case of the conduct­ing tissue of the plant a
very striking proof of the influence of the direction of current
on conductivity was afforded by the induced variation
of velocity of trans­mission. Equally striking is the
result which I have obtained with the nerve of the frog.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Experiment 44.</i>&mdash;The experiments described below were
carried out during the cold weather. The following records
(Fig.&nbsp;49), obtained by means of the pendulum myograph,
exhibit the effect of the direction of current on
the period of trans­mission through a given length of nerve.
The latent period of muscle being constant, the variations<span class="pagenum" title="128"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></span>
in the records exhibit changed rates of conduction. The
middle record is the normal, in the absence of any current.
The upper record, denoted by the left-hand arrow, shows
the action of a hetero­dromous current in shortening the
period of trans­mission and thus enhancing the velocity
above the normal rate. The lower record, denoted by
the right-hand arrow, exhibits the effect of a homodromous
current in retarding the velocity below the normal
rate. I find that a very feeble hetero­dromous current is
enough to induce a considerable increase of velocity, which
soon reaches a limit. For inducing retardation of velocity, a
relatively strong homo­dromous current is necessary. I give
below a table showing the results of several experiments.</p>

<h4>VARIATION OF INTENSITY OF TRANSMITTED EXCITATION
UNDER HETERODROMOUS AND HOMODROMOUS CURRENTS.</h4>

<p>In the next method of in­ves­ti­ga­tion, the induced variation
of intensity of transmitted excitation is inferred from
the varying amplitude of response of the terminal muscle.
Testing stimulus of sub-maximal intensity is applied at the
middle of the nerve, where the constant current induces no
variation of ex­cit­abil­ity. Stimulation is effected either by
single break-shock or by the summated effects of a definite
number of equi-alternating shocks, or by chemical stimulation</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="129"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Experiment 45.</i>&mdash;Under the action of feeble heterodromous
current the transmitted excitation was always enhanced,
whatever be the form of stimulation. This is seen
illustrated in Fig.&nbsp;50. Homodromous current on the other
hand inhibited or blocked excitation (<a href="#fig51">Fig.&nbsp;51</a>).</p>

<div><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 50.&mdash;Ineffectively transmitted salt-tetanus becoming effective under heterodromous
current, denoted by down-pointing arrow.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Complication due to variation of Excitability of Muscle</i>.&mdash;In
experiments with the plant, there was the unusual
advantage in having both the point of stimulation and the
responding motile organ in the middle or indifferent region.
Unfortunately this ideally perfect condition cannot be
secured in experiments with the nerve-and-muscle preparation
of the frog. It is true that the point of stimulation
in this case is chosen to lie on the nerve at the middle
or indifferent region. But the responding muscle is at
one end, not very distant from the electrode applied on
the tendon. It is, therefore, necessary to find out by
separate experiments any variation of ex­cit­abil­ity that
might be induced in the muscle by the proximity of either
the anode or the cathode, and make allowance for such
variation in interpreting the results obtained from in­ves­ti­ga­tions
on variation of conductivity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="130"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></span></p>

<p>In the experimental arrangement employed, the heterodromous
current is obtained by making the electrode on
the spine cathode and that on the tendon anode. The
depressing influence of the anode in this case may be
expected to lower, to a certain extent, the normal ex­cit­abil­ity
of the responding muscle. Conversely, with homodromous
current, the tendon is made the cathode and under
its influence the muscle might have its ex­cit­abil­ity raised
above the normal. These anticipations are fully supported
by results of experiments. Sub-maximal stimulus of equi-alternating
induction shock was directly applied to the
muscle and records taken of (<i>1</i>) response under normal condition
without any current, (<i>2</i>) response under heterodromous
current, the tendon being the anode, and (<i>3</i>) response
under homo­dromous current, the tendon being now made
the cathode. It was thus found that under heterodromous
current the ex­cit­abil­ity of the muscle was depressed, and
under homo­dromous current the ex­cit­abil­ity was enhanced.</p>

<p>The effect of current on response to direct stimulation
is thus opposite to that on response to transmitted excitation,
as will be seen in the following Table.</p>

<p class="tabtitle">TABLE VIII.&mdash;INFLUENCE OF DIRECTION OF CURRENT ON DIRECT AND
TRANSMITTED EFFECTS OF STIMULATION.</p>

<p>The passage of a current, therefore, induces opposing
effects on the conductivity of the nerve and the ex­cit­abil­ity
of the muscle, the resulting response being due to
their differential actions. Under hetero­dromous current a
more intense excitation is transmitted along the nerve, on
account of induced enhancement of conductivity. But this
intense excitation finds the responding muscle in a state<span class="pagenum" title="131"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></span>
of depressed ex­cit­abil­ity. In spite of this the resulting
response is enhanced (<a href="#fig50">Fig.&nbsp;50</a>). The enhancement of conduction
under hetero­dromous current is, in reality, much
greater than is indicated in the record. Similarly, under
homo­dromous current the depression of conduction in the
nerve may be so great as to cause even an abolition of
response, in spite of the enhanced ex­cit­abil­ity of the
muscle (Fig.&nbsp;51). The actual effects of current on conductivity
are, thus, far in excess of what are indicated in the
records.</p>


<h4>AFTER-EFFECTS OF HETERODROMOUS AND HOMODROMOUS
CURRENTS.</h4>

<p>On the cessation of a current there is induced in the
plant-tissue a transient conductivity change of opposite
sign to that induced by the direct current (<i>cf. <a href="#Experiment_43">Expt. 43</a></i>).
The same I find to be the case as regards the after-effect
of current on conductivity change in animal nerve. Of
this I only give a typical experiment of the direct and
after-effect of homo­dromous current on salt-tetanus.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 549px;">

<div><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 51.&mdash;Direct and after-effect of homo­dromous current. Transmitted excitation
(salt-tetanus T,) arrested under homo­dromous current denoted by up-pointing
arrow; on cessation of current represented by dotted line there is a transient
enhancement above the normal.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Experiment 46.</i>&mdash;In this experiment sufficient length of
time was allowed to elapse after the application of the salt<span class="pagenum" title="132"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span>
on the nerve, so that the muscle, in response to the transmitted
excitation, exhibited an incomplete tetanus T. The
homo­dromous current was next applied, with the result of
inducing a complete block of conduction, with the
concomitant disappearance of tetanus. The homodromous
current was gradually reduced to zero by the appropriate
movement of the potentiometer slide. The after-effect of
homo­dromous current is now seen in the transient enhancement
of transmitted excitation, which lasted for nearly
40 seconds. After this the normal conductivity was restored.
Repetition of the experiment gave similar results (Fig.&nbsp;51).</p>

<p>The results that have been given are only typical of
a very large number, which invariably supported the
char­ac­ter­is­tic phenomena that have been described.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that with feeble or moderate
current, conductivity is enhanced against the direction
of the current and depressed or blocked with the direction
of the current. Under strong current the normal effect is
liable to undergo a reversal.</p>

<p>It has thus been shown that a perfect parallelism exists
in the conductivity variation induced in the plant and in
the animal by the directive action of the current. No
explanation could be regarded as satisfactory which is not
applicable to both cases. Now with the plant we are
able to arrange the experimental condition in such a way
that the factor of variation of ex­cit­abil­ity is completely
eliminated. The various effects described about the plant-tissue
are, therefore, due entirely to variation of conductivity.
The parallel phenomena observed in the case of
trans­mission of excitation in the animal nerve must, therefore,
be due to the induced change of conductivity.</p>

<p>The action of an electrical current in inducing variation
of conductivity may be enunciated under the following<span class="pagenum" title="133"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span>
laws, which are equally applicable to the conduct­ing
tissue of the plant and the nerve of the <span class="nowrap">animal:&mdash;</span></p>


<h4>LAWS OF VARIATION OF NERVOUS CONDUCTION UNDER
THE ACTION OF ELECTRIC CURRENTS.</h4>

<p class="pl3hi">1. <span class="smcap">The passage of a current induces a variation of conductivity,

<p class="pl3hi">3. <span class="smcap">The after-effect of a feeble current is a transient conductivity

<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The variation of conductivity induced by the directive
action of current has been investigated by two different
<span class="nowrap">methods:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="pl3hi">(1) The method in which the normal speed and its
induced variation are automatically recorded;</p>

<p class="pl3hi">(2) That in which the variation in the intensity of
transmitted excitations is gauged by the varying
amplitudes of resulting responses.</p>

<p>The great difficulty arising from leakage of the exciting
induction current into the polarising circuit was
successfully overcome by the interposition of a choking
coil.</p>

<p>The following summarises the effects of direction and
intensity of an electric current, on trans­mission of excitation
through the conduct­ing tissue of the plant.</p>

<p>The velocity of trans­mission is enhanced against the
direction of a feeble current, and retarded in the direction
of the current.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="134"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span></p>

<p>Feeble hetero­dromous current enhances conductivity,
homo­dromous current, on the other hand, depresses it.</p>

<p>Ineffectively transmitted excitation becomes effectively
transmitted under hetero­dromous current. Effectively transmitted
excitation, on the other hand, becomes ineffectively
transmitted under the action of homo­dromous current.</p>

<p>The after-effect of a current is a transient conductivity
change, the sign of which is opposite to that induced
during the passage of current. The after-effect of a heterodromous
current is, thus, a transient depression, that of
homo­dromous current, a transient enhancement of conductivity.</p>

<p>The char­ac­ter­is­tic variations of conductivity induced in
animal nerve by the direction and intensity of current are
in every way similar to those induced in the conduct­ing
tissue of the plant.</p>

<p>These various effects are demonstrated by the employment
of not one, but various kinds of testing stimulus,
such as the excitation caused (1) by a single break-induction
shock or (2) by a series of equi-alternating
tetanising shocks or (3) by chemical stimulation.</p>

<h3>VIII.&mdash;EFFECT OF INDIRECT STIMULUS ON PULVINATED
ORGANS</h3>

<p>The leaf of <i>Mimosa pudica</i> undergoes an almost
instantaneous fall when the stimulus is applied directly on
the pulvinus which is the responding organ. The latent
period, <i>i.e.</i>, the interval between the application of stimulus
and the resulting response is about 0.1 second. Indirect
stimulus, <i>i.e.</i>, application of stimulus at a distance from the
pulvinus, also causes a fall of the leaf; but a longer
interval will elapse between the incidence of stimulus and
the response; for it will take a definite time for the
excitation to be conducted through the intervening tissue.
I have already shown that this conduction of excitation
in plant is analogous to the trans­mission of nervous
impulse in animal.</p>

<p>The power of conduction varies widely in different
plants. In the petiole of <i>Mimosa pudica</i> the velocity may
be as high as 30&nbsp;mm. per second. In the stem the
velocity is considerably less, <i>i.e.</i>, about 6&nbsp;mm. per
second in the longitudinal direction; but conduction across
the stem is a very much slower process. In the petiole of<span class="pagenum" title="136"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span>
<i>Averrhoa</i> the longitudinal velocity is of the order of 1&nbsp;mm.
per second.</p>


<h4>DUAL CHARACTER OF THE TRANSMITTED IMPULSE.</h4>

<p>The record of the transmitted effect of stimulus is found
to exhibit a remarkable preliminary variation. This was
detected by my delicate recorders, which gave magnifications
from fifty to hundred times. I shall give a detailed
account of a typical experiment carried out with <i>Averrhoa
carambola</i>, which will bring out clearly the char­ac­ter­is­tic
effects of Indirect Stimulus.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 363px;">

<div><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 52.&mdash;Effect of indirect Stimulus on leaflet of <i>Averrhoa carambola</i>. Stimulus
was applied at the short vertical line. Successive dots at intervals of
one second. Note the <i>positive</i> response preceding the <i>negative</i>.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Experiment 47.</i>&mdash;Stimulus of electric shock applied at a
point on the long petiole of <i>Averrhoa</i> causes successive fall
of pairs of leaflets. In the experiment to be described one<span class="pagenum" title="137"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>
of the leaflets of the plant was attached to the recorder.
Stimulus was applied at a distance of 50&nbsp;mm. The successive
dots in the record are at intervals of a second. It
will be noticed that two distinct impulses&mdash;a <i>positive</i> and
a <i>negative</i>&mdash;were generated by the action of Indirect Stimulus.
The positive impulse reached the responding organ
after 1.5 second and caused an erectile movement. The
velocity of the positive impulse in the present case is 33 mm.
per second. The normal excitatory negative impulse
reached the motile organ 44 seconds after the application
of stimulus, and caused a very rapid fall of the leaflet, the
fall being far more pronounced than the positive movement
of erection (Fig.&nbsp;52). In this and in all subsequent records,
the positive and negative responses offer a great contrast.
The movement in response to positive reaction is slow,
whereas that due to negative reaction is very abrupt, almost
‘explosive,’ the successive dots being now very wide apart.
As regards the velocity of impulse the relation is reversed,
the positive being the quicker of the two. In the
present case, the velocity of the excitatory <i>negative</i> impulse
is 1.1&nbsp;mm. per second, as against 33&nbsp;mm. of the <i>positive</i>
impulse.</p>

<p>The negative impulse is due to the comparatively slow
propagation of the excitatory protoplasmic change, which
brings about a diminution of turgor in the pulvinus and
fall of the responding leaflet. The erectile movement of
the leaflet by the positive impulse must be due to an
increase of turgor, brought on evidently, by the forcing
in of water. This presupposes a forcing out of water somewhere
else, probably at the point of application of stimulus.
It may be supposed that an active contraction occurred
in plant cells under direct stimulus, in consequence of
which water was forced out giving rise to a hydraulic
wave. On this supposition the positive impulse is to be
regarded as hydro-mechanical. I have, however, not yet<span class="pagenum" title="138"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span>
been able to devise a direct experimental test to settle the
question.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF DISTANCE OF APPLICATION OF STIMULUS.</h4>

<p>In the last experiment the stimulus was applied at the
moderate distance of 50&nbsp;mm. Let us now consider the
respective effects, first, of an increase, and second, of a
decrease of the intervening distance. In a tissue whose
conduct­ing power is not great, the excitatory impulse is
weakened, even to extinction in trans­mission through a long
distance. Thus the negative impulse may fail to reach
the responding organ, when the stimulus is feeble or the
intervening distance long or semi-conduct­ing. Hence, under
the above conditions, stimulus applied at a distance will
give rise only to a positive response.</p>

<p>A reduction of the intervening distance will give rise
to a different result. As the negative response is the more
intense of the two, the feeble positive will be masked by
the superposed negative. The separate exhibition of the two
responses is only possible by a sufficient lag of the negative
impulse behind the positive. This lag increases with
increase of length of trans­mission and decreases with the
diminution of the length. Hence the application of stimulus
near the responding organ will give rise only to a
negative response, in spite of the presence of the positive,
which becomes masked by the predominant negative<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a></span></p>

<p>These inferences have been fully borne out by results of
experiments carried out with various specimens of plants
under the action of diverse forms of stimuli. In all cases,
application of stimulus at a distance causes a pure positive
response; moderate reduction of the distance induces a
diphasic response&mdash;a positive followed by a negative; further<span class="pagenum" title="139"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></span>
diminution of distance gives rise to a resultant negative
response, the positive being masked by the predominant
negative.</p>

<p>From what has been said it will be understood that
the exhibition of positive response is favoured by the conditions,
that the transmitting tissue should be semi-conduct­ing,
and the stimulus feeble. It is thus easier to exhibit
the positive effect with the feebly conduct­ing petiole
of <i>Averrhoa</i> than with the better conduct­ing petiole of
<i>Mimosa</i>. It is, however, possible to obtain positive response
in the <i>Mimosa</i> by application of indirect stimulus to the
stem in which conduction is less rapid than in the petioles.</p>

<h3>IX.&mdash;MODIFYING INFLUENCE OF TONIC CONDITION
ON RESPONSE</h3>

<p>In experiments with different pulvinated organs, great
difference is noticed as regards their ex­cit­abil­ity. If electric
shock of increasing intensity from a secondary coil
be passed through the pulvini of <i>Mimosa</i>, <i>Neptunia</i>, and
<i>Erythrina</i> arranged in series, it would be found that
<i>Mimosa</i> would be the first to respond; a nearer approach
of the secondary coil to the primary would be necessary
for <i>Neptunia</i> to show sign of excitation. <i>Erythrina</i> would
require a far greater intensity of electric shock to induce
excitatory movement. Organs of different plants may thus
be arranged, according to their ex­cit­abil­ity, in a vertical
series, the one at the top being the most excitable. The
specific ex­cit­abil­ity of a given organ is different in different
species.</p>

<p>In addition to this char­ac­ter­is­tic difference, an identical
organ may, on account of favourable or unfavourable
conditions, exhibit wide variation in ex­cit­abil­ity. Thus
under favourable conditions of light, warmth and other
factors, the ex­cit­abil­ity of an organ is greatly enhanced.
In the absence of these favourable tonic conditions the
ex­cit­abil­ity is depressed or even abolished. I shall, for<span class="pagenum" title="142"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span>
convenience, distinguish the different tonic conditions of
the plant as <i>normal</i>, <i>hyper-tonic</i> and <i>sub-tonic</i>. In the first
case, stimulus of moderate intensity will induce excitation;
in the second, the ex­cit­abil­ity being exceptionally high,
very feeble stimulus will be found to precipitate excitatory
reaction. But a tissue in a <i>sub-tonic</i> condition will require
a very strong stimulus to bring about excitation. The
ex­cit­abil­ity of an organ is thus determined by two factors:
the specific ex­cit­abil­ity, and the tonic condition of the
tissue.</p>


<h4>THEORY OF ASSIMILATION AND DISSIMILATION.</h4>

<p>A muscle contracts under stimulus; this is assumed to
be due to some explosive chemical change which leaves
the tissue in a condition less capable of functioning, or
in a condition below par. Herring designates this as a
process of <i>dissimilation</i>. The ex­cit­abil­ity of the muscle is
restored after suitable periods of rest, by the opposite
metabolic change of <i>assimilation</i>. “Assimilation and Dissimilation
must be conceived as two closely interwoven processes,
which constitute the metabolism (unknown to us
in its intrinsic nature) of the living substance. Excitability
diminishes in proportion with the duration of D-stimulus,
or, as it is usually expressed, the substance <i>fatigues</i>
itself. It is perfectly intelligible that a progressive fatigue
and decrement of the magnitude of contraction must ensue.
The only point that is difficult to elucidate is the initial
staircase increment of the twitches, more especially in
excised, bloodless muscle, which seems in direct contradiction
with the previous theory.<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a></span></p>

<p>With reference to Herring’s theory given above, Bayliss
in his “Principles of General Physiology” (1915), page 377<span class="pagenum" title="143"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span>
says, “In the phenomenon of metabolism, two processes
must be distinguished, the building up of a complex system
or substance of high potential energy, ‘anabolism,’ and the
breaking down of such a system, ‘catabolism,’ giving off
energy in other forms. The tendency of much recent
work, however, is to throw doubt on the universality of
this opposition of anabolism and catabolism as explanatory
of physio­logic­al activity in general.”</p>

<p>The results obtained with the response of plants to stimulus
may perhaps throw some light on the obscurities
that surround the subject. They show that the two processes
may be present simultaneously, and that the ‘down’
change induced by stimulus may, in certain instances, be
more than compensated by the ‘up’ change<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a></span> I shall, for
convenience, designate the physico-chemical modi­fi­ca­tion, associated
with the excitatory negative mechanical and electrical
response of plants, as the “D” change; this is attended
by run down of energy. The positive mechanical and
electrical response must therefore connote opposite physico-chemical
change, with increase of potential energy. This I
shall designate as the “A” change, which by increasing the
latent energy, enhances the functional activity of the tissue.
That stimulus may give rise simultaneously to both A, and
D, effects, finds strong support in the dual reactions exhibited
in plant-response. Under indirect stimulus, the two
responses are seen separately, the more intense negative
following the feeble positive. When by the reduction of
the intervening distance, stimulus is made direct, the resultant
response, as previously stated, is negative; and this is
due not to the total absence of the positive but to its
being masked by the predominant negative. Let us next<span class="pagenum" title="144"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span>
consider the question of unmasking this positive element
in the resultant negative response.</p>


<h4>UNMASKING OF THE POSITIVE EFFECT.</h4>

<p>Under favourable conditions of the environment, the ex­cit­abil­ity
of the organs is at its maximum. A given
stimulus will bring about an intense excitation, and the
‘down’ D-change will therefore be very much greater than
the A-change. Let us now consider the case at the opposite
extreme where, owing to unfavourable condition, the ex­cit­abil­ity
is at its lowest. Under stimulus the excitatory D-change
will now be relatively feeble compared to the A-change,
by which the potential energy of the system becomes
increased. In such a case successive stimuli will increase the
functional activity of the tissue, and bring about staircase
response. Biedermann mentions the staircase response of
<i>excised bloodless muscle</i> as offering difficulty of explanation.
It is obvious that the physio­logic­al condition of the excised
muscle must have fallen below par. The staircase response
in such a tissue is thus explained from considerations that
have just been adduced.</p>

<p>The results obtained with <i>Mimosa</i> not only corroborate
them, but add incontestable proof of the simultaneous existence
of both A and D changes. The physio­logic­al condition
of a plant, <i>Mimosa</i> for example, is greatly modified by the
favourable or unfavourable condition of the environment. In
a hyper-tonic condition its ex­cit­abil­ity becomes very great;
in this condition the plant responds to its maximum even
under very feeble stimulus. Here the D-change is relatively
great, and successive responses are apt to show sign of
fatigue.</p>

the ef­fect of stimu­lus mo­di­fy­ing
toni­city and pro­duc­ing
stair­case effect. (<i>Mimosa</i>)</div>
</div>
<p>But the plant in a sub-tonic condition will exhibit
feeble or no excitation. The D-change will be absent
while the A-change will take place under the action of
stimulus. This, by increasing the potential energy, will
enhance the functional activity of the tissue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="145"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Staircase response in Mimosa: Experiment 48.</i>&mdash;The
theoretical considerations will be
found experimentally verified in the
record obtained with a specimen of
<i>Mimosa</i> in a sub-tonic condition
(Fig.&nbsp;53). Owing to the lack of
favourable ‘tone’ the leaf was relaxing
as seen in the first part of the
curve. The stimulus of electric
shock, applied at the thick dot in
the curve slanting downwards, gave
no response but raised the tone of
the tissue by arresting the growing
relaxation. Subsequent stimuli gave
rise to staircase responses. Stimulus
has, through the A-effect, raised the
functional activity of the tissue to
a maximum.</p>


<h4>ARTIFICIAL DEPRESSION OF TONIC CONDITION AND
MODIFICATION OF RESPONSE.</h4>

<p>It has been shown that while favourable tonic condition
has the effect of raising the ex­cit­abil­ity and enhancing
the negative response with the associated D-change, a condition
of sub-tonicity, on the other hand, induces depression
of ex­cit­abil­ity, a diminution of negative response and of the
attendant D-change. In this condition the positive element
in the response with the A-change will come into greater
prominence. These considerations led me to experiment with
specimens exhibit­ing increasing sub-tonicity, with a view of
unmasking the positive element in the response, <i>i.e.</i>, the
A-change. In the last experiment a specimen was found
which happened to be in a sub-tonic condition on account
of the unfavourable condition of its surroundings. I was
next desirous of securing specimens in which I could induce
increasing sub-tonicity at will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="146"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></span></p>

<p>I have shown (<i><a href="#Experiment_23">Expt. 23</a></i>) that a detached branch of
<i>Mimosa</i> can be kept alive for several days with the
cut end immersed in water. In this condition the pulvinus
retains its sensitiveness for more than two days.
The ex­cit­abil­ity undergoes a continuous decline and is
abolished about the fiftieth hour. Isolation from the
parent organism thus causes a continuous depression of the
tonic condition of the specimen. The case is somewhat
analogous to the depression of ex­cit­abil­ity in an excised
bloodless muscle. It is thus possible to secure specimens
of varying degrees of sub-tonicity. A specimen that has
been detached for six hours will exhibit a slight amount of
depression, while a different specimen isolated for twenty-four
hours will occupy a very much lower position in the
scale of tonicity.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 49.</i>&mdash;The staircase response of <i>Mimosa</i>
given in figure 53 was obtained with the stimulus of
induction shock. In order to establish a wider generalisation
I now used the stimulus of light given by an
arc lamp. There may be a difficulty on account of the
diurnal movement of <i>Mimosa</i>; the leaf, generally speaking,
has a movement in a downward direction from morning
till noon, after which there is a comparative state of
rest. It is better to choose the time of noon for experiment.
In any case the response to stimulus is very
abrupt and in strong contrast with the slow diurnal movement.
A horizontal pencil of light was thrown upwards
by means of a small mirror and made to fall on the
lower half of a pulvinus of the <i>Mimosa</i> leaf. The excitatory
down movement is followed by recovery on the
cessation of light. The intensity of stimulus can be
modified by varying the intensity of light. I took for
my first series of experiments a specimen that had been
isolated for six hours. Stimulation was caused by successive
applications of light for 25 seconds at intervals of<span class="pagenum" title="147"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span>
3 minutes. Figure 54 shows how the functional activity
of the sub-tonic specimen is enhanced by stimulus, the
successive responses thus exhibit­ing the staircase effect.</p>

</div>


<h4>POSITIVE RESPONSE IN SUB-TONIC SPECIMEN.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 50.</i>&mdash;A still lower degree of sub-tonicity was
ensured by keeping the specimen in an isolated condition
for 12 hours. Stimulus of light for 20 seconds’ duration
was applied at intervals of 2 minutes. In the record (Fig. 55)
the first two responses, not shown, were purely positive.
The third exhibited a positive A-effect, followed by the
negative response D-effect. The A-effect is thus seen fully
unmasked. In subsequent responses the A-effect became
more and more overshadowed by the D-effect. At the third
response the masking is complete and the excitatory negative
response is at its maximum. The record of staircase
effect (Fig.&nbsp;54) also exhibits a preliminary positive twitch
at the beginning of the series, which disappeared after
the second response.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="148"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></span></p>

<p>The modifying influence of tonic condition on response
I find to be of universal occurrence. In vigorous specimens
the electric response to stimulation is <i>negative</i>; but
tissues in sub-tonic condition give <i>positive</i> response and after
long-continued stimulation the abnormal positive is converted
into the normal <i>negative</i>. It is very interesting that
under condition of sub-tonicity diverse expressions of physio­logic­al
reaction exhibit similar change of sign of normal
response. Thus in my measurement of the velocity of
trans­mission of excitation in the conduct­ing tissue of
<i>Mimosa</i>, I find that, when the tissue is in an optimum
condition, exhibit­ing high velocity of trans­mission, excessive
stimulus has the effect of diminish­ing the conduct­ing
power. But in a depressed condition of the tissue
the effect is precisely the opposite. Thus in a given case
the velocity of trans­mission was low; strong electric stimulation
enhanced the rate by 33 per cent. In extreme
cases of sub-tonicity, where the conduct­ing power was in
abeyance, the excessive stimulus caused by wound not
only restored the power of conduction but raised the
velocity of trans­mission to 25&nbsp;mm. per second (<i><a href="#Experiment_37">Expt. 37</a></i>).</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The ex­cit­abil­ity of a plant is found to be modified
by its tonic condition.</p>

<p>A sub-tonic specimen of <i>Mimosa</i>, like an excised bloodless
muscle, shows a preliminary staircase response. Stimulus
induces simultaneously both “A” and “D” effects,
with their attendant positive and negative reactions.</p>

<p>A tissue in optimum condition exhibits only the resultant
negative response, the comparatively feeble positive being
masked by the predominant negative. With decline
of tone, the “D” effect diminishes and we get “A” effect
unmasked.</p>

<p>In extreme sub-tonic specimen, we get first only the
“A” effect, with its positive response. Successive stimulation
converts the pure positive into diphasic and ultimately
into normal negative response.</p>

<p>In discussing the difficulties connected with in­ves­ti­ga­tions
relating to longitudinal growth and its variations,
special stress must be laid on the importance of maintaining
external conditions absolutely constant. This constancy can
only be maintained in practice for a short time. Lengthy
periods of observation, moreover, introduce the uncertainty
of complication arising from spontaneous variation of
growth. The possibility of accurate in­ves­ti­ga­tion, therefore
lies in reducing the period of the experiment to a few
minutes during which we have to determine the normal
rate of growth and its variation under a given changed
condition. This would necessitate the devising of a method
of very high mag­ni­fi­ca­tion for record of the rate of
growth<span class="nowrap">.<a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a></span></p>

<p>With auxanometers now in use, which give a mag­ni­fi­ca­tion
of about twenty times, it takes nearly four hours to
determine the influence of changed condition in inducing<span class="pagenum" title="152"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></span>
variation of growth. It will be seen that if we succeeded in
enhancing mag­ni­fi­ca­tion from twenty to ten thousand times,
the necessary period for experiment would be reduced
from four hours to thirty seconds. The importance of securing
a mag­ni­fi­ca­tion of this order is sufficiently obvious.</p>

<p>The problem of high mag­ni­fi­ca­tion was first solved by
my Optical Lever<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a></span> The tip of the growing organ was
attached to the short arm of a lever, the axis of which
carried a small mirror; in this way it was possible to
obtain a mag­ni­fi­ca­tion of a thousand times. The magnified
movement of growth was followed with a pen on a revolving
drum. The record laboured under the disadvantage of
not being automatic. This defect was overcome by the use
of the photographic method which however entailed the
inconvenience and discomfort of a dark room.</p>

<p>I have, for the past six years, been working with a
different method, which has now been brought to a great
state of perfection. The problem to be solved was the
devising of a direct method of high mag­ni­fi­ca­tion and the
automatic record of the magnified rate of growth.</p>


<h4>METHOD OF HIGH MAGNIFICATION.</h4>

<p>The mag­ni­fi­ca­tion in my Crescograph is obtained by a
compound system of two levers. The growing plant is
attached to the short arm of a lever, the long arm of which
is attached to the short arm of the second lever. If the
mag­ni­fi­ca­tion by the first lever be <i>m</i>, and that by the
second, <i>n</i>, the resulting mag­ni­fi­ca­tion would be <i>mn</i>.</p>

<p>The practical difficulties met with in carrying out this
idea are very numerous. It will be understood that just as
the imperceptible movement is highly magnified by the<span class="pagenum" title="153"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></span>
compound system of levers, the various errors and difficulties
are likely to be magnified in the same proportion. The
principal difficulties met with were due: (1) to the weight
of the compound lever which exerted a great tension on
the growing plant, (2) to the yielding of flexible connections
by which the plant was attached to the first lever,
and the first lever to the second, and (3) to the friction at
the fulcrums.</p>

<p><i>Weight of the Lever.</i>&mdash;As the first lever is to exert a
pull on the second, it has to be made rigid. The second
lever serves as an index, and can therefore be made of
fine glass fibre. The securing of rigidity of the first lever
entails large cross section and consequent weight, which
exerts considerable tension on the plant. Excessive tension
greatly modifies growth; even the weight of the index used
in self-recording auxanometers is found to modify the normal
rate of growth. The weight of the levers introduces
an additional difficulty in the increased friction at the
fulcrums, on account of which there is an obstruction of
the free movement of the recording arm of the lever. The
conditions essential for overcoming these difficulties therefore
are: (1) construction of a very light lever possessing
sufficient rigidity, and (2) arranging the levers in such a
way that the tension on the plant may be reduced to any
extent, or even eliminated.</p>

<p>I found in <i>navaldum</i>, an alloy of aluminium, a light
material possessing sufficient rigidity. The first lever is constructed
out of a thin narrow sheet 25&nbsp;cm. in length;
it has, as explained before, to be fairly rigid in order to
exert a pull on the second without undergoing any bending;
this rigidity is secured by giving the thin narrow
plate of the lever a T-shape. The first lever balances, to
a certain extent, the second. Finer adjustments are made
by means of an adjustable counterpoise B, at the end of
the levers. By this means the tension on the plant can<span class="pagenum" title="154"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></span>
be greatly reduced; or a constant tension may be exerted
by means of a weight T (Fig.&nbsp;56). In my later type
of the apparatus the plant connection is made to the right,
instead of the left side of the first fulcrum. This gives
certain practical advantages. The second lever is then made
practically to balance the first, only a very slight weight
being necessary for exact counterpoise. The reduction of
total weight thus secured reduces materially the friction at
the fulcrum with great enhancement of efficiency of the
apparatus.</p>

record; B, B, balancing counterpoise. Fork F, carries at its side two conical
agate cups, on which lever rests by two pin-points. (From a photograph.)</div>
</div>

<p>The second or the recording lever has a normal excursion
through 8&nbsp;cm. on the recording surface, which is a
very thin sheet of glass 8×8&nbsp;cm. coated with a layer of
smoke. As the recording lever is about 40&nbsp;cm. in length,<span class="pagenum" title="155"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span>
the curvature in the record is slight, and practically negligible
in the middle portion of 4&nbsp;cm. The dimensions
given allow a mag­ni­fi­ca­tion of ten thousand times. A far
more compact apparatus is made with 15&nbsp;cm. length of
levers. This gives a mag­ni­fi­ca­tion of a thousand times.</p>


<h4>AUTOMATIC RECORD OF THE RATE OF GROWTH.</h4>

<p>Another great difficulty in obtaining an accurate record
of the curve of growth arises from the friction of contact
of the bent tip of the writing lever against the recording
surface. This I was able to overcome by an oscillating
device by which the contact, instead of being continuous,
was made intermittent. The smoked glass plate, G, is made
to oscillate, to and fro, at regular intervals of time, say
one second. The bent tip of the recording lever comes
periodically in contact with the glass plate during its extreme
forward oscillation. The record would thus consist
of a series of dots, the distance between successive dots
representing magnified growth during a second.</p>

<p>The drawback in connection with the obtaining of
record on the oscillating plate lies in the fact that if the
plate approaches the recording point with anything like
suddenness, then the stroke on the flexible lever causes an
after-oscillation; the multiple dots, thus produced, spoil the
record. In order to overcome this, a special contrivance
is necessary, by which the speed of approach of the plate
should be gradually reduced to zero at contact with the
recording point. The rate of recession should, on the other
hand, continuously increase from zero to maximum. The
recording point will in this manner be gently pressed
against the glass plate, marking the dot, and then gradually
set free. It was only after strict observance of these<span class="pagenum" title="156"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></span>
conditions that the disturbing effect of after-vibration of
the lever could be obviated.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a id="fig57"></a>

glass plate G. A, adjusting screws; L, recording lever. Clock releases string C
for lateral movement of the plate. (From a photograph.)</div>
</div>

<p>This particular contrivance consists of an eccentric rod
actuated by a rotating wheel. A cylindrical rod is supported
eccentrically, so that semi-rotation of the eccentric
causing a pull on the crank K (Fig.&nbsp;57) pushes the plate
carrier gradually forward. On the return movement of
the eccentric, a light antagonistic spring makes the plate
recede. The rate of the movement of the crank itself is
further regulated by the device of the revolving wheel.
This is released periodically by clockwork at intervals of
one, two, five, ten, or fifteen seconds respectively, according<span class="pagenum" title="157"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></span>
to the requirements of the experiment. The complete
apparatus is shown in figure 58.</p>

lowering the plant; C, clockwork for periodic oscillation of plate; W, rotating
wheel. V, cylindrical plant-chamber. (From a photograph.)</div>
</div>

<p><i>Connecting Links.</i>&mdash;Another puzzling difficulty lay in
the fact that the mag­ni­fi­ca­tion actually obtained was
sometimes very different from the calculated value. This
unreliability I was able to trace to the defects inherent
in thread connections, employed at first to attach the plant<span class="pagenum" title="158"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a></span>
to the first lever, and the first lever to the second. These
flexible connections were found to undergo a variable
amount of elastic yield. Hence it became necessary to
use nothing but rigid connections. The plant attachment,
A, of triangular shape is made of a piece of <i>navaldum</i>;
its knife-edge rests on a notch at the short arm of the
lever, L. There are several notches at various distances
from the fulcrum. It will be understood how the mag­ni­fi­ca­tion
can be modified by moving A, nearer or further
from the fulcrum. The lower end of the attachment is
bent in the form of a hook. The end of the leaf of the
plant P, is doubled on itself and tied. The loop thus
formed is then slipped over the hooked end of A.</p>

<p>The link, C, connecting L and L′, consists of a pin
pointed at both ends, which rests on two conical agate
cups fixed respectively to the upper and lower surfaces of
the levers L and L′. This mode of frictionless linking is
rigid and allows at the same time perfectly free movement
of the levers.</p>

<p><i>The fulcrum.</i>&mdash;The most serious difficulty was in connection
with frictionless support of the axes of the two levers.
The horizontal axis was at first supported on jewel bearings,
with fine screw adjustment for securing lateral support.
Any slight variation from absolute adjustment made the
bearing either too loose or too tight, preventing free play
of the lever. When perfect adjustment was secured by any
chance, the movement of the levers became jerky after a
few days. This I afterwards discovered was due to the
deposit of invisible particles of dust on the bearings. These
difficulties forced me to work out a very perfect and at the
same time a much simpler device. The lever now carries
two vertical pin-points which are supported on conical agate
cups. The axis of the lever passes through the points of
support. The friction of support is thus reduced to a
minimum. The levers are kept in place under the constant<span class="pagenum" title="159"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span>
pressure of their own weight. The excursion of the
end of the recording lever, which represents magnified
movement of growth, was now found to be without jerk
and quite uniform.</p>


<h4>EXPERIMENTAL ADJUSTMENTS.</h4>

<p>The soil in a flower pot is liable to be disturbed by
irrigation, and the record thus vitiated by physical disturbance.
This is obviated by wrapping a piece of cloth round
the root imbedded in a small quantity of soil. The lower
end of the plant is held securely by a clamp. In order
to subject the plant to the action of gases and vapours,
or to variation of temperature it is enclosed in a glass
cylinder (V) with an inlet and an outlet pipe (<a href="#fig58">Fig.&nbsp;58</a>). The
chamber is maintained in a humid condition by means of a
sponge soaked in water. Different gases, warm or cold water
vapours, may thus be introduced into the plant chamber.</p>

<p>Any quick growing organ of a plant will be found
suitable for experiment. In order to avoid all possible
disturbing action of circumnutation, it is preferable to employ
either radial organs, such as flower peduncles and buds
of certain flowers, or the limp leaves of various species of
grasses, and the pistils of flowers. It is also advisable to
select specimens in which the growth is uniform. I append
a representative list of various specimens in which,
under favourable conditions of season and temperature, the
rates of growth may be as high as those given <span class="nowrap">below:&mdash;</span></p>

The specimen employed for experiment may be an
intact plant, rooted in a flower pot. It is, however, more
convenient to employ cut specimens, the exposed end being
wrapped in moist cloth. The shock-effect of section passes
off after several hours, and the isolated organ renews its
growth in a normal manner. Among various specimens
I find <i>S. Kysoor</i> to be very suitable for experiments on
growth. The leaves are much stronger than those of
wheat and different grasses, and can bear a considerable
amount of pull without harm. Its rate of growth
under favourable condition of season is considerable.
Some specimens were found to have grown more than
8&nbsp;cm. in the course of twenty-four hours, or more
than 3&nbsp;mm. per hour. This was during the rainy season
in the month of August. But a month later the rate of
growth fell to about 1&nbsp;mm. per hour.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to describe certain typical experiments
which will show: (1) the extreme sensibility of the
Crescograph; (2) its wide applicability in different in­ves­ti­ga­tions;
and (3) its capability in determining with great
precision the time-relations of responsive changes in
the rate of growth. In describing these typical cases, I
shall give detailed account of the experimental methods
employed, and thus avoid repetition in accounts of subsequent
experiments.</p>

<p><i>Determination of the absolute rate of growth: Experiment
51.</i>&mdash;For the determination of the absolute rate, I
shall interpret the results of a record of growth obtained
with a vigorous specimen <i>S. Kysoor</i> on a stationary
plate. The oscillation frequency of the plate was once in
a second, and the mag­ni­fi­ca­tion employed was ten thousand
times. The magnified growth movement was so rapid that
the record consists of a series of short dashes instead of<span class="pagenum" title="161"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></span>
dots (Fig.&nbsp;59A). For securing regularity in the rate of
growth, it is advisable that the plant should be kept in uniform
darkness or in uniformly diffused light. So sensitive
is the recorder that it shows a change of growth-rate due
to the slight increase of illumination by the opening of an
additional window. One-sided light, moreover, gives rise to
disturbing phototropic curvature. With the precautions
described the growth-rate in vigorous specimens is found to
be very uniform.</p>

stationary plate; N, normal rate of growth; C, retarded rate under cold; H,
enhanced rate under warmth; (<i>b</i>) record on moving plate, where diminished
slope of curve denotes retarded rate under cold (Magnification 2,000 times.)</div>
</div>

<p>After the completion of the first vertical series, the
recording plate was moved 1&nbsp;cm. to the left; the tip of
the recorder was brought once more to the top by the
micrometer screw, S, (<a href="#fig58">Fig.&nbsp;58</a>), and the record taken once
more after an interval of 15 minutes. The magnified
growth for 4 seconds is 38&nbsp;mm. in the first record; it is
precisely the same in the record taken fifteen minutes
after. The successive growth elongations at intervals of 1
second is practically the same throughout, being 9.5&nbsp;mm.
This uniformity in the spacings demonstrates not only the<span class="pagenum" title="162"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></span>
regularity of growth under constant conditions, but also the
precision of the apparatus. It also shows that by keeping
the external condition constant, the normal growth-rate
could be maintained uniform for at least fifteen minutes.
The magnified rate of growth is nearly 1&nbsp;cm. per second, and
since it is quite easy to measure 0.5&nbsp;mm. the Crescograph
enables us to magnify and record a length of 0.0005&nbsp;mm.
that is to say, the sixteenth part of a wave of red light.
The absolute rate of growth, moreover, can be determined
in a period as short as 0.05 of a second. These facts
will give some idea of the great possibilities of the Crescograph
for future in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>

<p>As the period of experiment is very greatly shortened
by the method of high mag­ni­fi­ca­tion, I shall, in the
determination of the absolute rate of growth, adopt a
second as the unit of time, and µ, or <i>micron</i>, as the unit
of length,&mdash;the micron, being a millionth part of a metre
or a thousandth part of a millimeter.</p>

<p>If <i>m</i> be the magnifying power of the compound lever
and <i>l</i>, the average distance between successive dots in
mm. at intervals of <i>t</i> seconds <span class="nowrap">then:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="ml2em">
the rate of growth = <span class="nowrap"><span class="fraction"><span class="fnum"><i>l</i></span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden"><i>mt</i></span></span></span> × 10<sup>3</sup>µ per second.<br />
In the record given <i>l</i> = 9.5&nbsp;mm.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.2em;"><i>m</i> = 10,000.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.7em;"><i>t</i> = 1 second.</span><br />
Hence the rate of growth = <span class="nowrap"><span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">9 .5</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">10,000</span></span></span> × 10<sup>3</sup>µ per sec.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.2em;">= 0.95µ per sec.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Having demonstrated the extreme sensitiveness and
reliability of the apparatus, in quantitative determination,
I shall next proceed to show its wide applicability for
various researches relating to the influence of external
agencies in modi­fi­ca­tion of growth. For this two different
methods are employed. In the first of these methods, the
records are taken on a stationary plate: of these the<span class="pagenum" title="163"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span>
record is at first taken under normal condition, the subsequent
series being obtained under the given changed
condition; the increase or diminution of intervals between
successive dots, in the two series, at once demonstrates
the stimulating or depressing nature of the changed
condition.</p>

<p>In the second method, the record is taken on a plate
moving at an uniform rate by clockwork. A curve is
thus obtained, the ordinate representing growth elongation
and the abscissa the time. The increment of length divided
by the increment of time gives the absolute rate of
growth at any part of the curve. As long as the growth
is uniform, so long the slope of the curve remains constant.
If a stimulating agency enhances the rate of growth,
there is an immediate upward flexure in the curve; a
depressing agent, on the other hand, lessens the slope of
the curve.</p>

<p>I shall now give a few typical examples of the
employment of the Crescograph for in­ves­ti­ga­tions on
growth: the first example I shall take is the demonstration
of the influence of variation of temperature.</p>

<p><i>Stationary method: Experiment 52.</i>&mdash;The records, given
in <a href="#fig59">Fig.&nbsp;59</a><i>a</i>, were taken on a stationary plate. The
specimen was <i>S. Kysoor</i>; the Crescographic mag­ni­fi­ca­tion
was two thousand times, and the successive dots at
intervals of 5 seconds. The middle series, N, was at the
temperature of the room. The next, C, was obtained with
the temperature lowered by a few degrees. Finally H
was taken when the plant-chamber was warmed. It will
be seen how under cooling the spaces between successive
dots have become shortened, showing the diminished rate
of growth. Warming, on the other hand, caused a widening
of intervals between successive dots, thus demonstrating
an enhancement of the rate of growth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="164"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></span></p>

<span class="nowrap">find:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Moving plate method: Experiment 54.</i>&mdash;This was carried
out with a different specimen of <i>S. Kysoor</i>, the record
being taken on a moving plate (<a href="#fig59">Fig.&nbsp;59</a><i>b</i>). The first part
of the curve here represents the normal rate of growth.
The plant was then subjected to moderate cooling, the subsequent
curve with its diminished slope denotes the depression
of growth. The question of influence of temperature
will be treated in a subsequent Paper of the present series
in much greater detail.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Precaution against physical disturbance: Experiment 54.</i>&mdash;There
may be some misgiving about the employment of
such high mag­ni­fi­ca­tion: it may be thought that the
accuracy of the record might be vitiated by physical
disturbance, such as vibration. In physical experimentation
far greater difficulties have, however, been overcome,
and the problem of securing freedom from vibration is not
at all formidable. The whole apparatus need only be
placed on a heavy bracket screwed on the wall to ensure
against mechanical disturbance. The extent to which this
has been realized will be found from the inspection of the
first part of the record in figure 60, taken on a moving
plate. A thin dead twig was substituted for the growing
plant, and the perfectly horizontal record not only demonstrated
the absence of growth movement but also of all
disturbance. There is an element of physical change, against
which precautions have to be taken in experiments on variation
of the rate of growth at different temperatures. In
order to determine its character and extent, a record was
taken with the dead twig, of the effect of raising the temperature
of the plant-chamber through ten degrees. The record<span class="pagenum" title="165"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a></span>
(Fig.&nbsp;60) with a mag­ni­fi­ca­tion of two thousand times shows
that there is an expansion during
the rise of temperature,
and that the variable period
lasted for a minute, after
which there was a cessation
of physical movement, the
record becoming once more
horizontal. The obvious precautions
to be taken in such
a case, is to wait for several
minutes for the attainment
of steady temperature. The
movement caused by physical
change abates in a short time
whereas the change of rate of
growth brought about by physio­logic­al
reaction is persistent.</p>


<h4>DETERMINATION OF LATENT PERIOD AND TIME-RELATIONS
OF RESPONSE.</h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 260px;">

at in­ter­vals of 2 seconds.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Experiment 55.</i>&mdash;In the determination of time-relations
of responsive change in growth under external stimulus,
I shall take the typical case of the effect of electric
shock from a secondary coil of one second’s duration. Two
electrodes were applied, one above and the other below
the growing region of a bud of <i>Crinum</i>. The record was
taken on a moving plate, the mag­ni­fi­ca­tion employed being
two thousand times, and successive dots made at intervals
of two seconds. It was a matter of surprise to me to
find that the growth of the plant was affected by an
intensity of stimulus far below the limit of our own perception.
As regards the relative sensitiveness of plant and
animal, some of my experiments show that the leaf of
<i>Mimosa pudica</i> in a favourable condition responds to an
electric stimulus which is one-tenth the minimum intensity<span class="pagenum" title="166"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span>
that causes perception in a human being. For convenience
I shall designate the intensity of electric shock that is barely
perceptible to us as the unit shock. When an intensity of
0.25 unit was applied to the growing organ, it responded
to it by a retardation of growth. Inspection of Fig.&nbsp;61 shows
that there is a flexure induced
in the curve in response to
stimulus, the flattening of the
curve denoting retardation of
growth. The latent period, in
this case, is 6 seconds. The
normal rate was restored after
5 minutes. The intensity of
shock was next raised from
0.25 unit to one unit. The
second record shows that the
latent period is reduced to 4
seconds, and a relatively
greater retardation of growth
was induced by the action of
the stronger stimulus. The
recovery of the normal rate
was effected after the longer period of 10 minutes. I took
one more record, the intensity being three units. The
latent period was now reduced to 1 second, and the
induced retardation was so great as to effect a temporary
arrest of growth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="167"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></span>
It is thus found that growth in plants is affected by an
intensity of stimulus which is below human perception;
that with increasing stimulus the latent period is diminished
and the period of recovery increased; and that the induced
retardation of growth increases continuously with the stimulus
till at a critical intensity there is a temporary arrest
of growth. I shall speak later of the effect induced by
stimulus above this critical point.</p>

<div><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 62.&mdash;Record of a single growth-&#8203;pulse
of <i>Zephyr­anthes</i> (Mag­ni­fi­ca­tion 10,000
times.)</div>
</div>

<p><i>Experiment 56.</i>&mdash;As a further example of the capability
of the Crescograph, I shall give the record of a single
pulse of growth obtained with the peduncle of <i>Zephyranthes
Sulphurea</i> (Fig.&nbsp;62). The mag­ni­fi­ca­tion employed was
10,000 times, the successive
dots being at intervals of
one second. It will be seen
that the growth pulse commences
with a sudden
elongation, the maximum
rate being 0.4&nbsp;µ per sec.
The pulse exhausts itself in
15 seconds, after which
there is a partial recovery
in the course of 13 seconds.
The period of the complete
pulse is 28 seconds. The
resultant growth in each
pulse is therefore the difference
between elongation and recovery. Had a very highly
magnifying arrangement not been used, the resulting rate
would have appeared continuous. In other specimens, owing
probably to greater frequency of pulsation and co-operation
of numerous elements in growth, the rate appears to be
practically uniform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="168"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Advantages of the Crescograph.</i>&mdash;There is no existing
method which enables us to detect and measure such infinitesimal
movements and their time-relations. The only attempt
made in measuring minute growth has been by observing
the movement of a mark on a growing plant through a
microscope. The mag­ni­fi­ca­tion available in practice is about
250 times. The observation of the movement would itself
be sufficiently fatiguing. But a simultaneous estimate of the
time-relations of rapidly fluctuating changes would prove
so bewildering, that accurate results from this method would
be altogether impossible. A <span class="nowrap"><span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">12</span></span><span class="prime">″</span> </span> objective gives a linear enlargement
of about 1,200 times. But the employment of this
objective is impracticable in the measurement of growth
elongation of an ordinary plant. With the Crescograph, on
the other hand, we obtain a mag­ni­fi­ca­tion which far surpasses
the highest powers of a microscope, and it can be
used for all plants. It does not merely detect growth but
automatically records the rate of growth and its slightest
fluctuation. The extreme shortness of time required for an
experiment renders the study of the influence of a single
factor at a time possible, the other conditions being kept
constant. The Crescograph thus opens out a very extensive
field of inquiry into the physiology of growth; and the discovery
of several important phenomena mentioned in this
Paper is to be ascribed to the extreme sensitiveness of the
apparatus, and the accuracy of the method employed.</p>


<h4>MAGNETIC AMPLIFICATION.</h4>

<p>The mag­ni­fi­ca­tion obtained with two levers was, as stated
before, 10,000 times. It may be thought that further
mag­ni­fi­ca­tion is possible by a compound system of three
levers. There is, however, a limit to the number of levers
that may be employed with advantage, for the slight overweight
of the last lever becomes multiplied and exerts very<span class="pagenum" title="169"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></span>
great tension on the plant, which interferes with the normal
rate of its growth. The friction at the bearings also becomes
added up by an increase in the number of levers, and
this interferes with the uniformity of the movement of the
last recording lever. For securing further mag­ni­fi­ca­tion,
additional material contact has, therefore, to be abandoned.
I have recently been successful in devising an ideal method
of mag­ni­fi­ca­tion without contact. The movement of the
lever of the Crescograph upsets a very delicately balanced
magnetic system. The indicator is a reflected spot of light
from a mirror carried by the deflected magnet. Taking
a single lever with the lengths of two arms 125&nbsp;mm. and
2.5&nbsp;mm. respectively we obtain a mag­ni­fi­ca­tion of 50
times. The magnetic system gives a further mag­ni­fi­ca­tion
of 20,000 the total mag­ni­fi­ca­tion being thus a
million times. This was verified by moving by means of
a micrometer screw the short arm of the lever through
0.005&nbsp;mm. The resulting deflection of the spot of light at
a distance of 4 metres was found to be 5,000&nbsp;mm. or a
million times the movement of the short arm. It is not
difficult to produce a further mag­ni­fi­ca­tion of 50 times by
attaching a second lever to the first. The total mag­ni­fi­ca­tion
would in this case be 50 million times.</p>

<p>A concrete idea of this will be obtained when we realise
that by the Magnetic Crescograph a mag­ni­fi­ca­tion can be
obtained which is about 50,000 times greater than that
produced by the highest power of a microscope. This order
of mag­ni­fi­ca­tion would lengthen a wave of sodium light to
about 3,000&nbsp;cm. I am not aware of any existing method
by which it is possible to secure an amplification of
this order of magnitude. The application of this will
undoubtedly be of great help in many physical in­ves­ti­ga­tions,
some of which I hope to complete in the near future.</p>

<p>Such an enormous mag­ni­fi­ca­tion cannot be employed
in ordinary in­ves­ti­ga­tions on growth, for the moving spot<span class="pagenum" title="170"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a></span>
of light indicating rate of growth, passes like a flash
across the screen. But it is of signal service in my in­ves­ti­ga­tions
on growth by the Method of Balance, to be
described in a future Paper. The principle of this method
consists in making the spot of light, which is moving in
response to growth, stationary, by subjecting the plant to a
compensating movement downwards. The slightest variation
caused by an external agent would make the spot of light
move either to the right or to the left, according to the
stimulating or depressing character of the agent. It
will be understood, how extremely sensitive this method
is for detection of the most minute variation in the normal
rate of growth.</p>


<h4>THE DEMONSTRATION CRESCOGRAPH.</h4>

<p>Before proceeding with accounts of further in­ves­ti­ga­tions,
I shall describe a form of Magnetic Crescograph
with which I have been able to give before a large
audience demonstration of a striking character on various
phenomena of growth. The mag­ni­fi­ca­tion obtained was
so great that I had to take some trouble in reducing it.
This was accomplished by the employment of a single,
instead of a compound system of two levers. The reflected
spot of light was thrown on a screen placed at a
distance of 4 metres, and this gave a mag­ni­fi­ca­tion of a
million times; it is obvious that an increase of the distance
of the screen to 8 metres would have given a mag­ni­fi­ca­tion
of 2 million times. As it was, even the lower mag­ni­fi­ca­tion
was far too great for use with quick growing plants
like <i>Kysoor</i>. I, therefore, employed the slower growing
flower bud of <i>Crinum</i>. It will be seen from <a href="#TABLE_X">Table X</a>
that the normal rate of growth of the lily is of the order
of 0.0006&nbsp;mm. per second. The normal excursion of the
spot of light reflected from the Crescograph exhibit­ing<span class="pagenum" title="171"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a></span>
growth was found to be 3 metres in five seconds or
60&nbsp;cm. per second. This is a million times the actual
rate of growth of the <i>Crinum</i> bud. As it is easy to
measure 5&nbsp;mm. in the scale, it will be seen that with
the Demonstration Crescograph it is possible to detect the
growth of a plant for a period shorter than a hundredth
part of a second.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 57.</i>&mdash;A scale 3 metres long divided into
cm. is placed against the screen. A metronome beating
half seconds is started at the moment when the spot
of light transits across the zero division; the number
of beats is counted till the index traverses the 300&nbsp;cm.
At the normal temperature of the room (30°C.), the
index traversed 300&nbsp;cm. in five seconds. The plant
chamber was next cooled to 26°C. by the blowing in of
cooled water vapour; the time taken by the spot of light
to traverse the scale was now 20 seconds, <i>i.e.</i>, the growth-rate
was depressed to a fourth. Under continuous lowering
of temperature the growth-rate became slowed down
till at 21°C. there was an arrest of growth. Warm
vapour was next introduced, gradually raising the temperature
of the chamber to 35°C. The spot of light now
rushed across the scale in a second and a half, <i>i.e.</i>, the
growth was enhanced to more than three times the
normal rate. The entire series of the above experiments,
on the effect of temperature on growth, was thus completed
in the course of 15 minutes.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>A description is given of the High Magnification
Crescograph, which enables an automatic record of growth
magnified ten thousand times. The absolute rate of growth
can be easily determined from the data given in the
record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="172"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span></p>

<p>A mag­ni­fi­ca­tion of a million times is obtained by the
employment of Magnetic amplification. An increment of
growth so minute as a millionth part of a mm. or
0.00000004 inch may thus be detected. It is also possible
to detect the growth of a plant for a period shorter
than a hundredth part of a second.</p>

<p>The influence of external conditions on variation of
rate of growth is obtained by two methods of record. In
<span class="lowercase smcap">STATIONARY METHOD</span>, the increase or diminution of the
distance between successive dots representing magnified rate
of growth, demonstrates the stimulating or depressing
nature of the changed condition.</p>

<p>In the second, or <span class="lowercase smcap">MOVING PLATE METHOD</span>, a curve is
obtained, the ordinate representing growth elongation, and
the abscissa, time. A stimulating agent causes an upward
flexure of the normal curve; a depressing agent, on the
other hand, lessens the slope of the curve.</p>

<p>The action of external stimulus induces a variation of
the rate of growth, the time relations of which are found
from the automatic record of the growth. The latent
period is shortened with the intensity of the stimulus. A
responsive variation of growth is induced by an intensity
of stimulus which is below human perception.</p>

<p>It is often possible to obtain record of the pulsatory
nature of growth-elongation. Thus, with the growing
peduncle of <i>Zephyranthes</i>, the growth pulse commences with
a sudden elongation, the maximum rate being 0.0004 mm.
per second. The pulse exhausts itself in 15 seconds,
after which there is a partial recovery in course of 13
seconds, the period of complete pulse being 28 seconds.
The resultant growth in each pulse is the difference between
elongation and recovery.</p>

<p>The Magnetic Crescograph enables demonstration of
principal phenomena of growth and its variation before a
large audience.</p>

<h3>XI.&mdash;EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON GROWTH</h3>

<p>Accurate determination of the effect of temperature on
growth presents many serious difficulties on account of
numerous complicating factors. In nature, the upper part
of the plant is exposed to the temperature of the air, while
the root underground is at a very different temperature.
Growth, we shall find, is modified to a certain extent by
the ascent of sap. (See <a href="#Page_189">p.&nbsp;189</a>, <i>Expt. <ins title="Transcriber’s note: ‘69’ in original text">70</ins></i>.) The activity of
this latter process is determined by the temperature to which
the roots are subjected. The difficulty may be removed to
a certain extent by placing the plant in a thermal chamber,
with arrangement for regulating the temperature of the
air. The air is a bad conductor of heat, and there is some
uncertainty of the interior of the plant attaining the temperature
of the surrounding air, unless the plant is long
exposed to the definite and constant temperature of the plant
chamber. Observation of the effects of different temperatures
then becomes a prolonged process, with the
possibility of vitiation of results by autonomous variation
of growth. Reduction of the period of experiment by
rapidly raising the temperature of the chamber introduces
fresh difficulties; for a sudden variation of temperature
often acts like an excitatory shock. This drawback may<span class="pagenum" title="174"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></span>
to some extent be obviated by ensuring a gradual change
of temperature. This is by no means an easy process, for
even with care the rise of temperature of the air cannot
be made perfectly uniform, and any slight irregularity gives
rise to sudden fluctuations in the magnified record of growth.
Another difficulty arises from the radiation of heat-rays
from the sides of the thermal chamber. These rays, I shall
in a different Paper show, induce a retardation of growth.
The effect of rise of temperature in ac­cel­er­ation of growth
is thus antagonised by the action of thermal radiation.
This trouble may be minimised by having the inner surface
of the thermal chamber of bright polished metal, since the
radiating power of a polished surface is relatively feeble.</p>

<p>The contrivance which I employ for ensuring a gradual
rise of temperature, consists of a double-walled cylindrical
metallic vessel; the plant is placed in the inner chamber,
the walls of which are coated with electrically deposited
silver and polished afterwards, and at the bottom of which
there is a little water. The space between the inner and
outer cylinder is filled with water, in which is immersed a
coiled copper pipe. Hot water from a small boiler enters
the inlet of the coiled pipe and passes through the outlet
at the lower end. The water in the outer cylinder is thus
gradually raised by flow of hot water in the coiled pipe.
The rate of flow of hot water, on which the rate of rise of
temperature depends, is regulated by a stop-cock. The air
of the inner chamber in which the plant is placed, may
thus be adjusted for a definite temperature. The small
quantity of water in the inner chamber keeps its air in
a humid condition, since dry hot air by causing dessication
interferes with normal growth.</p>


<h4>METHOD OF DISCONTINUOUS OBSERVATION.</h4>

<div><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 63.&mdash;Effect of tem­pera­ture on growth, and de­ter­min­ation of opti­mum tem­pera­ture.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Experiment 58.</i>&mdash;High mag­ni­fi­ca­tion records are taken for
successive periods of ten seconds, for selected temperatures,<span class="pagenum" title="175"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></span>
maintained constant during the particular observation. In
figure 63 is given records of rate of
growth obtained with a specimen of
<i>Kysoor</i> at certain selected temperatures.
It will be seen that the rate
of growth increases with the rise of
temperature to an optimum, beyond
which the growth-rate undergoes a
depression. In the present case the
optimum temperature is in the neighbourhood
of 35°C.</p>


<h4>METHOD OF CONTINUOUS OBSERVATION.</h4>

<p>The method of observation that I have described above
is not ideally perfect, but the best that could be devised
under the circumstances. A very troublesome complication
of pulsations in growth, arises at high temperatures, which
render further record extremely difficult. Growth is undoubtedly
a pulsatory phenomenon; but under favourable
circumstances, these merge practically into a continuous
average rate of elongation. At a high temperature the effect
of certain disturbing factors comes into prominence. This
may be due to some slight fluctuation in the temperature
of the chamber, or to the effect of thermal radiation from
the side of the chamber. This disturbing influence is most
noticed at about 45°C, rendering the record of growth
above this point a matter of great uncertainty. It will<span class="pagenum" title="176"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a></span>
presently be shown that in plants immersed in water-bath
growth is often found to persist even up to 57°C.</p>

<p>The only way of removing the complication arising from
thermal radiation lies in varying the temperature condition
of the plant, by direct contact with water at different temperatures.
This procedure will also remove uncertainty
regarding the body of the plant assuming the temperature
of surrounding non-conduct­ing air. The disturbing effect of
sudden variation of temperature is also obviated by a more
uniform regulation of rise of temperature. The inner
cylinder containing the plant is filled with water; heat from
gradually warmed water in the outer cylinder is conducted
across the inner cylinder made of thin copper and raises
the temperature of the water contained in the inner cylinder
with great uniformity. A clock-hand goes round once in
a minute; the experimenter, keeping his hand on the stop-cock,
adjusts the rate of rise of water in the inner cylinder,
so that there is a rise, say, of one-tenth of a degree
every 6 seconds or of one degree every minute. The mass
of water acts as a governor, and prevents any sudden
fluctuations of temperature. The adoption of this particular
device eliminated the erratic changes in the rate of
growth that had hitherto proved so baffling.</p>

<p>The elongation recorded by the Crescograph will now be
made up of (1) physical expansion, (2) expansion brought
about by absorption of water, and (3) the pure ac­cel­er­ation
of growth. The disentanglement of these different elements
presented many difficulties. I was, however, able to find out
the relative values of the first two factors in reference to
the elongation of growth. This was done by carrying out
a preliminary experiment with a specimen of plant in which
growth had been completed. It was raised through 20°C in
temperature, records being taken both at the beginning and
at the end. This was for obtaining a measure of the<span class="pagenum" title="177"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a></span>
physical change due to temperature, and also of the change
brought about by absorption of water. I should state here
that for the method of continuous record of growth which
I contemplated, the record had to be taken for about 18
minutes. The mag­ni­fi­ca­tion had to be lowered to 250
times to keep the record within the plate. With this mag­ni­fi­ca­tion,
the fully grown specimen did not show in the
record a change even of 1&nbsp;mm. in length in 18 minutes,
while the growing plant under similar circumstances exhibited
an elongation of 100&nbsp;mm. or more. In records
taken with low mag­ni­fi­ca­tion, the effect of physical change
is quite negligible.</p>


<h4>DETERMINATION OF THE CARDINAL POINTS OF GROWTH.</h4>

<p>The cardinal points of growth are not the same in
different plants; they are modified in the same species
by the climate to which the plants are habituated; the
results obtained in the tropics may thus be different
from those obtained in colder climates. At the time of
the experiment, the prevailing temperature at Calcutta in
day time was about 30°C.</p>

<p><i>Temperature minimum: Experiment 59.</i>&mdash;For the determination
of the minimum, I took a specimen of <i>S. Kysoor</i>,
and subjected it to a continuous lowering of temperature,
by regular flow of ice-cold water in the outer vessel of the
plant-chamber. Record was taken on a moving plate for
every degree fall of temperature; growth was found to be
continuously depressed, till an arrest of growth took place at
22°C. (Fig.&nbsp;64).</p>

<p>The arrested growth was feebly revived at 23°C., after
which with further rise of temperature there was increased
ac­cel­er­ation. The optimum point was reached at about 34°C.<span class="pagenum" title="178"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a></span>
In some plants the optimum is reached at about 28°C., and
the rate remains constant for the next 10 degrees or more.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Temperature maximum: Experiment 60.</i>&mdash;For the determination
of the maximum, the temperature was raised much
higher. At 55°C. growth was found to be greatly retarded
with practical arrest at 58°C. At 60°C. there occurred
a sudden spasmodic contraction (Fig.&nbsp;65), which I have
shown elsewhere to be the spasm of death. This mechanical
spasm at 60°C. is also strikingly shown by various pulvinated
organs. An electric spasm of gal­vano­metric negativity,
and a sudden diminution of electrical resistance also take
place at the critical temperature of 60°C<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a></span></p>

<p>I have described the immediate effect at the critical
point. Long maintenance at a temperature few degrees<span class="pagenum" title="179"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a></span>
below 60°C. will no doubt be attended with the death of
the organ. Fatigue is also found to lower the death-point.</p>


<h4>THE THERMO-CRESCENT CURVE.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 66.</i>&mdash;I was next desirous of devising a method
by which an automatic and continuous record of the plant
should enable us to obtain a curve, which would give
the rate of growth at any temperature, from the arrested
growth at the minimum to a temperature as high as 40°C.
In order to eliminate the elements of spontaneous variation,
the entire record had to be completed within a reasonable
length of time, say about 18 minutes for a rise of as many
degrees in temperature. This gives a rate of rise of 1°C.
for one minute. Separate experiments showed that at this
rate of <i>continuous</i> rise of temperature there is practically
no lag in the temperature assumed by thin specimens of
plants. For observation during a limited range I use the
slower rate of rise at 1°C. per two minutes. But the result
obtained by slower rise was found not to differ from
that obtained with one degree rise per minute. The curve
of growth is taken on a moving plate, which travels 5&nbsp;mm.
per minute. Successive dots are made by the recording
lever at intervals of a minute during which the rise of
temperature is 1°C. A <i>Thermo-crescent Curve</i> is thus obtained,
the ordinate of which represents increment of growth, and
the abscissa, the time. As the temperature is made to rise
one degree per minute, the abscissa also represents rise of
temperature (Fig.&nbsp;66). The vertical distance between two
successive dots thus gives increment of growth in one minute
for 1 degree rise of temperature from T to T′. If <i>l</i> represents
this length, <i>t</i> the interval of time (here 60 sec.), and
<i>m</i> the magnifying power of the recorder, then the rate of<span class="pagenum" title="180"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a></span>
growth for the mean temperature <span class="nowrap"><span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">(T+T′)</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> is found from the formula:

<p>It will thus be seen that, in the course of an experiment
lasting about twenty minutes, data have been obtained
which enable us to determine the rates of growth through
a wide range of temperature. We have likewise been able
by the first method to make very accurate determinations
of the temperature maximum and minimum. In short, by
adopting the methods described, the cardinal points of
growth and the rate of growth at any temperature, may
be determined with a precision unattainable by the older
methods, of averages or of prolonged observation.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>Temperature induces variation in the rate of growth.
In accurate determination of the growth, the disturbing
effect of radiation of heat has not been eliminated.</p>

<p>A continuous record of growth under uniform rise of
temperature gives the Thermo-crescent curve, from which
the rate of growth at any temperature may be deduced.</p>

<p>Different plant-tissues exhibit char­ac­ter­is­tic differences
in their cardinal points of growth. In <i>Kysoor</i>, growth is
arrested at the temperature minimum of 22°C. The
optimum temperature is at 34°C., after which growth-rate
declines and becomes completely arrested at 58°C. At 60°C.
there is a sudden spasmodic contraction of death.</p>

<p>In other plants the cardinal points are different. In
some plants the optimum growth is attained at 28°C. and
remains constant up to 38°C.</p>

<h3>XII.&mdash;THE EFFECT OF CHEMICAL AGENTS ON
GROWTH</h3>

<p class="tac mt1em"><i>By</i></p>

<p class="tac mtb1em"><span class="smcap">Sir J.&nbsp;C. Bose</span>,</p>

<p class="tac"><i>Assisted by</i></p>

<p class="tac mtb1em"><span class="smcap">Guruprasanna Das</span>.</p>


<p>Chemical agents are found to exert char­ac­ter­is­tic actions
on growth. The method of in­ves­ti­ga­tion sketched here
opens out an extended field of in­ves­ti­ga­tion. The effect
of a chemical substance, I find, to be modified by (1) the
strength of the solution, (2) the duration of application,
and (3) the condition of the tissue. A poisonous substance
in minute doses is often found to exert a stimulating
action. Too long continued action of a stimulant, on the
other hand, exerts a depressing effect. The influence of
the tonic condition is shown by the fact that while a
given dilution of a poisonous substance kills a weak
specimen, the same poisonous solution, applied to a vigorous
specimen, actually stimulates and enhances the rate of the
growth. I give below descriptions of a few typical reactions.</p>

<p>The reagent, when in a liquid form, is locally applied
on the growing organ. The records, taken before and after
the application, exhibit the stimulatory or depressing
character of the reagent. A different method of application
of the reagent is employed for plants with extended<span class="pagenum" title="184"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a></span>
region of growth. The specimen is then enclosed in a
glass cylinder, with inlet and outlet pipes. The cylinder is
first filled with water, and the normal rate of growth
recorded. This rate remains constant for several hours;
but prevention of access of air for too long a time affects
the normal growth. After obtaining normal record, water
charged with the giving chemical agent is passed into the
cylinder; and the subsequent record shows the char­ac­ter­is­tic
effect of the reagent. The introduction of a gas into
the chamber offers no difficulty.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF STIMULANTS.</h4>

<p><i>Hydrogen Peroxide: Experiment 62.</i>&mdash;This reagent, as
supplied by Messrs. Parke Davis &amp; Co., was diluted to 1
per cent. and applied to the growing plant. Its stimulating
action on growth is demonstrated in the right hand record
of Fig.&nbsp;68<i>a</i>, where the rate of growth is seen enhanced
two and a half times the normal rate.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Ammonia: Experiment 63.</i>&mdash;The immediate effect of
dilute vapour of this reagent is an enhancement of growth,<span class="pagenum" title="185"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></span>
seen in the middle record of Fig.&nbsp;68<i>b</i>, where the rate is
seen to be double the normal. Continued action, however,
caused a depression; the third record of this series shows
this, where the reduction is three-fourths of the normal rate.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF ANÆSTHETICS.</h4>

</div>

<p><i>Ether: Experiment 64.</i>&mdash;In Fig.&nbsp;68<i>c</i>, the records exhibit
the effect of introduction of ether vapour into the plant
chamber, and its recovery after the removal of the vapour.
Ether is seen to depress the rate of growth to a little more
than a third of the normal rate. The recovery is seen
to be nearly complete half an hour after the removal of
the vapour.</p>


<p><i>Carbonic Acid: Experiment 65.</i>&mdash;The action of this gas
is very remarkable. The plant was immersed in water
and normal record taken; the
plant chamber was now filled
with water, charged with
carbonic acid gas. This induced
a very marked ac­cel­er­ation of
growth (Fig.&nbsp;69). In a seedling
of Onion, the increase
was found to be two and a
half times. In the flower bud
of <i>Crinum</i>, the rate was found
enhanced threefold from the
normal 0.25&nbsp;µ to 0.75&nbsp;µ per
second. After this preliminary
enhancement, there was a depression
of growth within 15
minutes of the application, the<span class="pagenum" title="186"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a></span>
rate being now reduced to 0.15&nbsp;µ per second. These effects
were found to take place equally in light or in darkness.</p>


<h4>ACTION OF DIFFERENT GASES.</h4>

<p><i>Coal Gas: Experiment 66.</i>&mdash;Coal gas induces a depression.
It is curious that subjection to the action of this gas
does not produce so evil an effect as one would expect.
The introduction of the gas had reduced the growth-rate
to more than half; but there was a recovery half an
hour after the introduction of fresh air.</p>

<p><i>Sulphuretted Hydrogen: Experiment 67.</i>&mdash;This gas not
only exerts a depressing effect, but its after-effect is also
very persistent. The plant experimented on was very
vigorous and its rate of growth was depressed to half by
subjection to the action of the gas for a short time. The
record taken half an hour after the introduction of fresh air
did not exhibit any recovery.</p>


<h4>ACTION OF POISONS.</h4>

<p><i>Ammonium Sulphide: Experiment 68.</i>&mdash;This reagent in
dilute solution retards growth, and in stronger solution acts
as a poison. The following results were obtained with a
wheat seedling under different strengths of <span class="nowrap">solution:&mdash;</span></p>

<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The effect of a chemical agent is modified by the
strength of the solution, the duration of application and
the tonic condition of the tissue.</p>

<p>Dilute solution of hydrogen peroxide induces an ac­cel­er­ation
of growth.</p>

<p>The action of dilute vapour of ammonia is a preliminary
enhancement followed by depression of growth.</p>

<p>Ether vapour depresses the rate of growth. On the removal
of the vapour there is a recovery of the normal
rate.</p>

<p>The effect of carbonic acid is a great enhancement of
the rate of growth; after this preliminary action, growth
undergoes a decline. The effect described takes place
equally in light or in darkness.</p>

<p>Coal gas induces a depression of the rate of growth
from which there is a recovery after the removal of the
gas. The action of sulphuretted hydrogen is far more
toxic, the after-effect being very persistent.</p>

<p>Solution of ammonium sulphide induces increasing retardation
of growth, with the strength of the solution.
Copper sulphate solution acts as a toxic agent, retarding
the rate of growth and ultimately killing the plant.</p>

<h3>XIII.&mdash;EFFECT OF VARIATION OF TURGOR AND OF
TENSION ON GROWTH</h3>

<p class="tac mt1em"><i>By</i></p>

<p class="tac mtb1em"><span class="smcap">Sir J.&nbsp;C. Bose.</span></p>


<p>The movements of leaves of sensitive plants are caused
by variation of turgor in the pulvinus induced by
stimulus. The down movement or <i>negative</i> response of
<i>Mimosa</i> is caused by a diminution or negative variation of
turgor, while the erection or <i>positive</i> response is brought
about by an increase, or positive variation of turgor.</p>

<p>We shall now investigate the change induced in a
growing organ in the rate of growth by variation of turgor.
Turgor may be increased by enhancing the rate of ascent
of sap or by an artificial increase of internal hydrostatic
pressure. A diminution of turgor may, on the other hand,
be produced by withdrawal of water through plasmolysis.
In order to maintain a constant terminology I shall designate
an increase, as the positive, and a diminution, the
negative variation of turgor.</p>


<h4>RESPONSE TO POSITIVE VARIATION OF TURGOR.</h4>

<p>In experimenting with <i>Mimosa</i> the plant was subjected to
the condition of drought, water being withheld for a day.
On supplying water, the leaf, after a short period,
exhibited a positive or erectile movement (<i><a href="#Experiment_12">Expt. 12</a></i>).
The delay was evidently due to the time taken by the
water absorbed by root to reach the responding organ.</p>

drought, C. ac­cel­er­ation after irri­ga­tion with cold water, H. en­hanced
ac­cel­er­ation on irri­ga­tion with warm water. (<i>S. Kysoor</i>)</div>
</div>

<p><i>Method of Irrigation: Experiment 70.</i>&mdash;In order to investigate
the effect of enhanced turgor on growth, I took a specimen of<span class="pagenum" title="189"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a></span>
<i>Kysoor</i> which had been dug up with an attached quantity of
soil; this latter was enclosed in a small bag. The plant was
then securely clamped and fixed on a stand. This precaution
was taken to prevent upward displacement by the swelling
of the soil in flower pot of the plant under irrigation.
The specimen was then subjected to a condition of drought,
water being withheld for a day. The depressed rate of
growth is seen in record (Fig.&nbsp;70). Ordinary cold water
was now applied at the root, the effect of
which is seen in record C. Finally the
record (H) was obtained after irrigation with
tepid water. It will be seen that the spaces
between successive dots, representing magnified
growth at intervals of ten seconds, are
very different. While a given elongation
took place under drought in 19 × 10 seconds,
a similar lengthening took place, after irrigation
with cold water, in 13 × 10 seconds,
and after irrigation with warm water in
3 × 10 seconds. Irrigation with warm water
is thus seen to increase the rate of growth
more than six times.</p>

<p>The enhancement of the rate of growth on irrigation
with cold water took place after seventy seconds. The
interval will obviously depend on the distance between
the root by which the water is absorbed and the region
of growth. It will further depend on the activity of the
process of the ascent of sap. The time interval is greatly
reduced when this activity is in any way increased. Thus
the responsive growth elongation after application of warm
water was very much quicker; in the case described it was
less than 20 seconds. With regard to application of warm<span class="pagenum" title="190"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a></span>
water, the variation of temperature should not be too
sudden; it should commence with tepid, and end with warm
water. <i>Sudden</i> application of hot water brings about certain
complications due to excitatory effect. As regards the persistence
of after-effect of a single application of warm
water, it should be remembered that the absorbed water
gradually cools down. In an experiment with a peduncle
of <i>Zephyranthes</i> the growth under partial drought was found
to be 0.04&nbsp;µ per second; application of warm water increased
the growth rate to 0.20&nbsp;µ per second. After 15 minutes the
growth rate fell to 0.13&nbsp;µ per second; and after an hour
to 0.08&nbsp;µ per second. It will be noted that even then the
rate was twice the initial rate before irrigation.</p>

<h4>EFFECT OF ARTIFICIAL INCREASE OF INTERNAL

<p>Increased turgor was, next, artificially induced by increase
of internal hydrostatic pressure.</p>

the short limb of an U-tube, and subjected to increased
hydrostatic pressure by increasing the height of the water<span class="pagenum" title="191"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></span>
in the longer limb. Table XIII shows how increasing pressure
enhances the rate of growth till a critical point is
reached, beyond which there is a depression. This critical
point varies in different plants.</p>

<h4>RESPONSE TO NEGATIVE VARIATION OF TURGOR.</h4>

<p>I shall now describe the influence of induced diminution
of turgor on the rate of growth.</p>

the growth rate of 0.04&nbsp;µ per second
was enhanced to 0.20&nbsp;µ per second
after irrigation. A strong solution of
<span class="pagenum" title="192"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></span>KNO<sub>3</sub> was now applied at the root;
and the growth-rate fell almost immediately to 0.03&nbsp;µ per
second, or nearly to one-third the previous rate, the depression
induced being thus greater than under condition of
drought (Fig.&nbsp;71).</p>

<p>From the series of results that have been given above,
it will be seen that employing very different methods of
turgor variation, the rate of growth, within limits, is enhanced
by an increase of turgor. A diminution or negative
variation of turgor, on the other hand, brings about
a retardation or negative variation in the rate of growth.
We should, in this connection, bear in mind the fact that,
growth is dependent on protoplasmic activity, and the variation
of turgor itself is also determined by that activity.</p>

<h3>XIV.&mdash;EFFECT OF ELECTRIC STIMULUS ON GROWTH</h3>

<p class="tac mt1em"><i>By</i></p>

<p class="tac mtb1em"><span class="smcap">Sir J.&nbsp;C. Bose,</span></p>

<p>In plant physiology, the word ‘stimulus’ is often used
in a very indefinite manner. This is probably due to the
different meanings which have been attached to the word.
An agent is said to <i>stimulate</i> growth, when it induces an
ac­cel­er­ation. But the normal effect of stimulus is to cause
a retardation of growth. It is probably on account of
lack of precision in the use of the term that we often
find it stated, that a stimulus sometimes accelerates, and
at other times, retards growth. In order to avoid any
ambiguity, it is very desirable that the term stimulus
should always be used in the sense as definite as in
animal physiology. An induction shock, a condenser
discharge, the make or break of a constant current, a
sudden variation of temperature, and a mechanical shock
bring about an excitatory contraction in a muscle. These
various forms of stimuli cause, as we have seen, a similar
excitatory contraction of the motile pulvinus of <i>Mimosa
pudica</i>. We shall enquire whether the diverse forms
of stimuli enumerated above, exert similar or different
reactions on the growing organ.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF ELECTRIC STIMULUS OF VARYING INTENSITY
AND DURATION.</h4>

<p>The form of stimulus which is extensively used in
physio­logic­al in­ves­ti­ga­tions, is the electric stimulus of<span class="pagenum" title="196"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a></span>
induction shock which is easily graduated by the use of
the well known sliding induction coil, in which the
approach of the secondary to the primary coil, indicated
by the higher reading of the scale, gives rise to
increasing intensity of stimulus. The retarding effect of
electrical stimulus on growth has already been demonstrated
in record taken on a moving plate (<a href="#fig61">Fig.&nbsp;61</a>).</p>

<p>I shall adopt for unit stimulus, that intensity of electric
shock which induces a barely perceptible sensation in a
human being. It is very interesting to find, as stated
before, that growth is often affected by an electric stimulus,
which is below the range of human perception.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Effect of Intensity: Experiment 74.</i>&mdash;I shall now describe
a typical experiment on the effect of intensity of<span class="pagenum" title="197"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a></span>
stimulus in retarding the rate of growth. The normal
rate of growth of the bud of <i>Crinum</i> was 0.35&nbsp;µ per
second. On the application of electric shock of unit intensity
for 5 seconds, the rate became reduced to 0.22&nbsp;µ per
second. When the stimulus was increased to 2 units, the
retarded rate of growth was 0.07&nbsp;µ per second. When
the intensity was raised to 4 units, there was a complete
arrest of growth. In figure 72 is given records of a
different experiment which show the effects of increasing
intensity of stimulus in retardation of growth.</p>

The last record exhibits the actual shorten­ing of the grow­ing organ under
strong stimu­lus.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Effect of continuous stimulation: Experiment 75.</i>&mdash;The
effect of continuous stimulation of increasing intensity
will be seen in the record (Fig.&nbsp;73), taken on a
moving plate. On application of continuous stimulus of
increasing intensity an increased flexure was produced in
the curve, which denoted greater retardation in the rate<span class="pagenum" title="198"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a></span>
of growth. When the intensity of stimulus was raised to
3 units, there was induced an actual contraction.</p>


<h4>CONTINUITY BETWEEN INCIPIENT AND ACTUAL
CONTRACTION.</h4>

<p>It will thus be seen, that external stimulus of electric
shock induces a reaction which is of opposite sign to
the normal growth elongation or expansion. We may conveniently
describe this effect as ‘incipient’ contraction;
for under increasing intensity of stimulus, the contractile
reaction, opposing growth elongation, becomes more and
more pronounced; at an intermediate stage this results
in an arrest of growth; at the further stage, it culminates
in an actual shortening of the organ. There is no
break of continuity in all these stages. I shall, therefore,
use the term ‘contraction’ in a wider sense, including
the ‘incipient’ which finds expression in a retardation
of growth.</p>

<p>In Table XVI is given the results of certain typical
experiments on the effect of stimulus of increasing intensity
and duration.</p>

With regard to the question of immediate and after-effect
of stimulus, I find great difficulty in drawing a
line of demarcation. Owing to physio­logic­al inertia there
is a delay between the application of stimulus and the
initiation of responsive reaction (latent period); owing to
the same inertia, the physio­logic­al reaction is continued
even on the cessation of stimulus. All responsive reactions
are thus after-effects in reality. The latent period is
shortened under strong stimulus, but the contractile reaction
becomes more persistent. When the stimulus is moderate
or feeble, the recovery from incipient contraction takes place
within a short time. Stimulus, under certain circumstances,
is found to improve the ‘tone’ of the tissue, and as we
shall presently see bring about, as the after-effect, an
enhancement of the rate of growth.</p>

<p>The effect of electric stimulus is thus an incipient
or actual contraction.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>In normal conditions electric stimulus induces an incipient
contraction exhibited by the retardation of the rate
of growth. Growth is often affected by an electric stimulus
which is below human perception.</p>

<p>Under increasing intensity of stimulus, the contractile
reaction opposing growth elongation becomes more and
more pronounced. At a critical intensity of stimulus
growth becomes arrested. Under stronger intensity of
stimulus growing organ undergoes an actual shortening in
length.</p>

<p>There is continuity between the incipient contraction
seen in retardation, arrest of growth, and contraction of
the organ under stronger stimulus.</p>

<p>The latent period of responsive variation of growth
is shortened under stronger stimulus, but the period of
recovery becomes protracted.</p>

<p>Amongst the various stimuli which induce excitation in
<i>Mimosa</i> may be mentioned the irritation caused by rough
contact, by prick, or wound. Friction causes moderate stimulation,
from which the excited pulvinus recovers within a
short time. But a prick or a cut induces a far more intense
and persistent excitation; the recovery becomes protracted,
and the wounded pulvinus remains contracted for
a long period.</p>

<p>I shall now describe the effect of mechanical irritation
on growth. For moderate stimulus, I employ rough contact
or friction; more intense stimulation is caused by a
prick or a cut.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF MECHANICAL IRRITATION.</h4>

<div>(<i>b</i>) N, normal; W, immediately after wound; C, an hour after.</div>

<div>(Successive dots at intervals of 5″.)</div>
</div>

<p><i>Experiment 76.</i>&mdash;In this experiment, I took a peduncle
of <i>Zephyranthes</i>, which had a normal rate of growth of 0.18&nbsp;µ
per second. I then caused mechanical irritation by rubbing
the surface with a piece of card-board. The mechanical
stimulation was found to have caused a retardation of
growth, the depressed rate being 0.11&nbsp;µ per second, or three-fifths
the normal rate. As this particular mode of stimulation
was very moderate, the normal of rate growth was
found to be restored after a short period of rest. After 15<span class="pagenum" title="201"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a></span>
minutes the rate became 0.14&nbsp;µ per second; after an
hour the recovery was complete, the rate being now
0.18&nbsp;µ per second, the normal rate before stimulation
(Fig 74<i>a</i>). We shall presently see that not only is the
growth rate greatly depressed under intense stimulation,
but the period of recovery also becomes very much protracted.</p>


<p>I have often been puzzled by the fact, that specimens
apparently vigorous exhibited little or no growth, after
attachment to the recorder. After waiting in vain for an
hour, I had to discard them for others with equally unsatisfactory
results. One of these specimens happened to be
left attached to the recorder overnight, and I was surprised
to find that the specimen, which had shown no growth the
previous evening, was now exhibit­ing vigorous growth after
being left to itself for 12 hours. I then realised that the<span class="pagenum" title="202"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a></span>
temporary abolition of growth must have been due to the
irritation of somewhat rough handling during the process
of mounting and attachment of the specimen to the recorder.</p>

<p>In the matter of mechanical stimulation, some specimens
are more irritable than others. The persistence of after-effect
of irritation in retardation of growth will be demonstrated
in the following experiments, where the stimulus
employed was more intense.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF WOUND.</h4>

<p>A prick causes an intense excitation in <i>Mimosa</i>. I tried
the effect of this form of stimulation on responsive variation
in growth.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 77.</i>&mdash;The specimen was the same as had been
employed in the last experiment. After moderate stimulation
due to friction it had, in the course of an hour, completely
recovered its normal rate of growth of 0.18&nbsp;µ per
second. I now applied the stimulus of pin prick; the actual
injury to the tissue due to this was relatively slight; but the
retardation of growth induced by this more intense mode
of stimulation was very great. With moderate mechanical
friction the rate had fallen from 0.18&nbsp;µ to 0.11&nbsp;µ per
second, <i>i.e.</i>, to three-fifths the normal rate: in consequence
of prick the depression was from 0.18&nbsp;µ to 0.05&nbsp;µ per
second, <i>i.e.</i>, to less than a third of the normal rate. After
15 minutes the rate recovered from 0.05&nbsp;µ to 0.07&nbsp;µ per
second. After moderate friction the recovery was complete
after an hour; but in this case the recovery after an
equal interval was only three-fourths of the original, the
rate being now 0.12&nbsp;µ per second (<a href="#fig74">Fig.&nbsp;<ins title="Transcriber’s note: Incorrectly stated as ‘33’ in original text.">74</ins></a>b). I next applied
the more intense stimulus caused by a longitudinal cut<span class="pagenum" title="203"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a></span>
This caused a depression of growth rate to 0.04&nbsp;µ per
second. A transverse cut, I find, gives rise to a more
intense stimulation, than a longitudinal slit.</p>

<p>The effect of mechanical stimulus on growth is thus
similar to that induced by electrical stimulus. Moderate
stimulus of rough contact induces an incipient contraction,
seen in retardation of growth, the recovery being complete
in the course of an hour; but intense stimulation, induced<span class="pagenum" title="204"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a></span>
by wound, gives rise to greater and more, persistent retardation
of growth.</p>

<h3>XVI.&mdash;ACTION OF LIGHT ON GROWTH</h3>

<p class="tac mt1em"><i>By</i></p>

<p>The next subject of inquiry is the <i>normal</i> effect of light
on growth. I speak of the normal effect because, under
certain definite conditions, to be described in a later Paper,
the response undergoes a reversal. The Crescograph is
so extremely sensitive that it records the effect of even
the slightest variation of light. Thus, as I have already
mentioned, the opening of the blinds of a moderately-lighted
room induces, within a short time, a marked
change in the record of the rate of growth. The conditions
of the experiment would thus become more precise
if the growth-rate in the absence of light is taken as the
normal. The specimens are, therefore, kept for several
hours in darkness before the experiment. But this should
not be carried to the extent of lowering the healthy tone
of the plant.</p>

<p>I shall, in the present Paper, determine the char­ac­ter­is­tic
response to light in variation of growth, the latent period
of response, the effects of light of increasing intensity and
duration, and the effects of the visible and invisible rays of
the spectrum.</p>


<h4>METHOD OF EXPERIMENT.</h4>

<p>The plant was placed in a glass chamber kept in humid
condition. The sources of light employed were: (1) an<span class="pagenum" title="206"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a></span>
arc-lamp with self-regulating arrangement for securing steadiness
of light, and (2) an incandescent electric lamp. Two
inclined mirrors were placed close behind the specimen so
that it should be acted on by light from all sides.</p>


<h4>NORMAL EFFECT OF LIGHT.</h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 180px;">

<div><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 75.&mdash;Normal effect of light. N, normal; S, re­tard­ed rate of growth in re­sponse
to light; N, re­cov­ery on ces­sa­tion of light.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Experiment 78.</i>&mdash;I shall first give records obtained with
<i>Kysoor</i> on the action of light. The first series exhibits the
normal rate of growth in darkness; in the next the retarding
effect of light is seen in the shortening of spacings, as
compared with the normal, between successive dots. The
light was next cut off and record taken
once more after half an hour. Growth is
now seen to have recovered its normal
rate (<ins title="Transcriber’s note: No trace of the recording could be seen in this figure.">Fig.&nbsp;75</ins>). With regard to the after-effect
of light I may say in anticipation that
there are two different results, which depend
on the physio­logic­al condition of the tissue.
In a tissue whose tonic condition is below
par, the after-effect is an ac­cel­er­ation; but
with tissues in an optimum condition, the
immediate after-effect is a retardation of the
rate of growth. This is specially the case
when the incident light is of strong intensity
and of long duration.</p>


<h4>DETERMINATION OF THE LATENT PERIOD.</h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 267px;">
<a id="fig76"></a>
<img src="images/fig76.jpg" width="267" height="228" alt="" />
<div><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 76.&mdash;Latent period and time-re­la­tions of re­sponse to light, applied at thick
line. Suc­ces­sive dots at in­ter­vals of 5 sec.</div>
</div>

<p>There is a general impression that it takes from several
minutes to more than an hour for the light to react on
the growing organ. This underestimate must have been<span class="pagenum" title="207"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></span>
due to the want of sufficient delicate means of observation.
For my recorders indicate in some cases a response
within less than 2 seconds of the incidence of light.
This was found, for example, in the record of response
given by a seedling of <i>Cucurbita</i>, to a flash of ultra-violet
light. In the majority of cases the response is observed
within 15 seconds of the incidence of light.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 79.</i>&mdash;For the determination of the latent
period, a record of the effect of arc light of 30 seconds’
duration was taken on a moving plate. It will be noticed
(Fig.&nbsp;76) that a retardation of growth was induced
within 35 seconds of the incidence of light. The incipient
contraction induced by light is thus similar to
that induced by any other form of stimulus. Growth
became restored to the normal value, 5 minutes after the
cessation of stimulus.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF INTENSITY OF LIGHT.</h4>

</div>

<p><i>Experiment 80.</i>&mdash;I next studied the action of light,
the intensity of which was increased in arithmetical<span class="pagenum" title="208"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a></span>
progression. The intensity of white light given by a
half-watt incandescent electric lamp of 200 candle power,
placed at a distance of a metre, is taken as the unit.
Much feebler light would have been sufficient, but it would
have required much longer exposure. The intensity was
increased by bringing the lamp nearer the plant; marks
were made on a horizontal scale so
that the intensity of incident light
increased at the successive marks of
the scale as 1: 2: 3: and so on. The
duration of exposure was same in all
cases, namely, 5 minutes. After each
experiment suitable periods of rest
were allowed for the plant to recover
its normal rate of growth. Records
in Fig.&nbsp;77 show increasing retardation
induced by stronger intensities of
light. Table XVIII gives the result
of a different experiment.</p>

<h4>EFFECT OF CONTINUOUS LIGHT.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 81.</i>&mdash;The continued effect of light of moderate
intensity in bringing about increasing retardation of growth<span class="pagenum" title="209"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a></span>
will be seen in Fig.&nbsp;78(<i>b</i>) side by side with the record of
effect of continuous electric stimulation (Fig.&nbsp;78<i>a</i>) on
growth. In both the cases the effect of continuous stimulation
is seen to be the same, namely, a growing retardation,
which in the given instances culminated in arrest of
growth. This is true of stimulus of moderate intensity.
Under a more intense stimulation the incipient contraction
does not end in a mere arrest of growth, but the
responding organ undergoes an actual shortening.</p>

<h4>EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT RAYS OF THE SPECTRUM.</h4>

<p>Different observers have <span class="nowrap">found<a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a></span> that it is the more refrangible
rays which exercise the greatest influence upon growth
and tropic curvature. The relative effects of different lights
will, however, become more precise from the curves of response
to the action of different rays. For this purpose, I
first employed monochromatic lights from different parts of
the spectrum, produced by prism of high dispersion. In
practice, the usual colour filters were found very convenient,
as they allowed the application of more intense
light. A thick stratum of bichromate of potash solution<span class="pagenum" title="210"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a></span>
transmitted red rays, a thinner stratum allowed the trans­mission
of yellow in addition; ammoniated copper sulphate
solution allowed the blue and violet rays to pass
through. It should be borne in mind that certain complicating
factors are introduced by the incidence of light on
the organ; there may be a slight rise of the temperature.
We have seen however that moderate rise of temperature
induces an ac­cel­er­ation of the rate of growth (<a href="#Page_175">p.&nbsp;175</a>). I shall
later describe other experiments which will demonstrate the
antagonistic effects of light and warmth on growth.
Warmth again may induce a certain amount of dessication,
but this is reduced to a minimum by maintaining the
plant-chamber in a humid condition. The heating effect of
the red is, relatively speaking, much greater than that of
the blue rays. But in spite of this it is found that while
red rays are practically ineffective, the blue rays are most
effective in inducing responsive retardation of growth.</p>

<p><i>Effect of red and yellow light.</i>&mdash;These rays had little
or no effect in inducing variation of growth.</p>

<p><i>Effect of blue light: Experiment 82.</i>&mdash;The blue rays exerted
a marked retarding effect on growth. Light was applied
for 34 seconds and retardation was initiated within 14
seconds of the incidence of light, and the retarded rate
was two-fifths of the normal (Fig.&nbsp;79B).</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="211"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Effect of ultra-violet light: Experiment 83.</i>&mdash;Ultra-violet
light was obtained from a quartz mercury vapour lamp.
The effect of this light in retardation of growth was very
marked. Response was induced within 10 seconds, the
maximum retardation being one-sixth of the normal rate
(Fig.&nbsp;79V).</p>

<p><i>Effect of infra-red rays: Experiment 84.</i>&mdash;In passing
from the most refrangible ultra-violet to the less refrangible
red rays, the responsive retardation of growth undergoes
a diminution and practical abolition. Proceeding further
in the infra-red region of thermal rays, it is found that
these latter rays become suddenly effective in inducing
retardation of growth.</p>

<p>A curve drawn with the wave length of light as abscissa,
and effectiveness of the ray as ordinate shows a fall towards
zero as we proceed from the ultra-violet wave towards
the red; the curve, however, shoots up as we proceed
further in the region of the infra-red. In connection with
this it should be remembered that while the thermal rays
induce a retardation of growth, rise of temperature, up
to an optimum point, gives rise to the precisely opposite
reaction of ac­cel­er­ation of growth.</p>

<p>The relative effectiveness of various rays on growth will
be seen more strikingly demonstrated in records of photo-tropic
curvature to be given in a succeeding Paper.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The normal effect of light is incipient contraction or
retardation of the rate of growth.</p>

<p>The latent period may in some cases be as short as
2 seconds. In large number of cases it is about 15 seconds.
The latent period is shortened under stronger intensity of
light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="212"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a></span></p>

<p>Increasing intensity of light induces increasing retardation
and arrest of growth. Under continued action of light
of strong intensity the growing organ may undergo an
actual shortening.</p>

<p>In these reactions the action of stimulus of light resembles
the effects of electric and mechanical stimuli.</p>

<p>The ultra-violet rays induce the most intense reaction
in retardation of growth. The less refrangible yellow and
red rays are practically ineffective. But the infra-red rays
induce a marked retardation of growth.</p>

<p>The effects of light and warmth are antagonistic. The
former induces a retardation and the latter an ac­cel­er­ation
of growth.</p>

<h3>XVII.&mdash;EFFECT OF INDIRECT STIMULUS ON GROWTH</h3>

<p class="tac mt1em"><i>By</i></p>

<p class="tac mtb1em"><span class="smcap">Sir J.&nbsp;C. Bose</span>,</p>

<p>It has been shown that the direct application of stimulus
gives rise in different organs to contraction, diminution of
turgor, fall of motile leaf, electro-motive change of gal­vano­metric
negativity, and retardation of the rate of growth. I
shall now inquire whether Indirect stimulus, that is to say,
application of stimulus at some distance from the responding
organ, gives rise to an effect different from that of
direct application.</p>


<h4>MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL RESPONSE TO INDIRECT
STIMULUS.</h4>

<p>I have already described the effect of Indirect stimulus
on motile organs (<a href="#Page_136">p.&nbsp;136</a>). A feeble stimulus applied at a
distance was found to induce an erectile movement or positive
response of the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i> or of the leaflet of
<i>Averrhoa</i>. This reaction is indicative of increase of turgor,
an effect which is diametrically opposite to the diminution
of turgor induced by the effect of Direct stimulus. It was
also shown that an increase in the intensity of Indirect
stimulus or a diminution of the intervening distance<span class="pagenum" title="214"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a></span>
brought about a diphasic response, positive followed by
negative. Direct stimulus gave rise only to a negative
response.</p>

<p><i>Electric response to Indirect stimulus.</i>&mdash;I have already
explained how an identical reaction finds diverse expression
in mechanical and electrical response, or in responsive
variation of the rate of growth. It is of interest in
this connection to state that my attention was first directed
to the char­ac­ter­is­tic difference between the effects of Direct
and Indirect stimulus from the study of electric response
of vegetable tissues. I found that while <i>Direct</i> stimulus
induced negative electric response, <i>Indirect</i> stimulus gave
rise to a positive response. The clue thus obtained led
to the discovery of positive mechanical response under
Indirect stimulus.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 335px;">
<a id="fig80"></a>
<img src="images/fig80.jpg" width="335" height="192" alt="" />
<div><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 80.&mdash;Electric response of <i>Musa</i> (<i>a</i>) Positive, (<i>b</i>) diphasic, (<i>c</i>) negative.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Experiment 85.</i>&mdash;The records given in Fig.&nbsp;80, exhibit
the electric response given by vegetable tissues. On application
of feeble stimulus at a distance from the responding
point, the response was by gal­vano­metric positivity. Under<span class="pagenum" title="215"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a></span>
stronger stimulus the response became diphasic, positive
followed by negative. Direct stimulus induced a negative
response.</p>


<h4>VARIATION OF GROWTH UNDER INDIRECT STIMULUS.</h4>

<p>Since the responsive reactions of growing and non-growing
organs are, as we shall find later, fundamentally
similar, I expected that Indirect stimulus would give rise
in a growing organ to an effect which would be of opposite
sign to that induced by Direct stimulus&mdash;an ac­cel­er­ation,
instead of retardation of growth; that would correspond to
the positive mechanical and electrical responses to Indirect
stimulus given by pulvinated organs and by ordinary
vegetable tissues. The account of the following typical
experiment will show that my anticipations have been
fully verified.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 86.</i>&mdash;I took a growing bud of <i>Crinum</i> and
determined the region of its growth activity; lower down
a region was found where the growth had attained its
maximum and may, therefore, be regarded as indifferent
region. I applied two electrodes in this indifferent region
about 1&nbsp;cm. below the region of growth. On application
of moderate electric stimulus of short duration the response
was by an ac­cel­er­ation of growth which persisted for nearly
a minute, after which there was a resumption of the
normal rate of growth. In this particular case the interval
of time between the application of stimulus and the
responsive ac­cel­er­ation of growth was 12 seconds. The
interval varies in different cases from one second to 20
seconds or more, depending on the intervening distance
between the point of application of stimulus and the<span class="pagenum" title="216"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a></span>
responding region of growth. I give a record (Fig.&nbsp;81)
obtained in a different experiment which shows in an
identical specimen, (1) an ac­cel­er­ation of growth under
Indirect and (2) a retardation of growth under Direct
stimulus.</p>

It is thus seen that the effect of Indirect stimulus
on growth-variation is precisely parallel to that obtained
with the response of sensitive plant; that is to say,
the effect induced by a feeble stimulus applied at a
distance from the growing region is a positive variation or
ac­cel­er­ation of growth. The effect becomes converted into
negative or retardation of growth when the stimulus is
Direct, <i>i.e.</i>, when applied to the responding region of growth;
under intermediate conditions, the growth-variation I find
to be diphasic, a positive ac­cel­er­ation followed by a negative
retardation. This is found true not merely in the case of
a particular form of stimulus but of stimuli as different
as mechanical, thermal, electric, and photic.</p>

<p>I shall in a subsequent paper formulate a generalised
Law of Effects of Direct and Indirect Stimulus. From the
experiments already described it is seen that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Direct stimulus induces negative variation of turgor,
contraction, fall of leaf of</i> Mimosa, <i>electric change
of gal­vano­metric negativity, and retardation of
the rate of growth.</i></p>

<p><i>Indirect stimulus induces positive variation of turgor,
expansion, erection of leaf of</i> Mimosa, <i>electrical
change of gal­vano­metric positivity, and ac­cel­er­ation
of the rate of growth.</i></p></div>

<p>It is seen that Indirect stimulus gives rise to dual reactions,
seen in positive and negative responses; of these the
negative is the more intense. When the intervening distance
is reduced, the resulting response becomes negative; this is
due not to the absence of the positive, but to its being
masked by the predominant negative. From the principle of
continuity, this will also hold good in the limiting case,
where by the reduction of the intervening distance to
zero, the stimulus becomes Direct. In other words, Direct
stimulus should also give rise to both positive and nega<span class="pagenum" title="218"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a></span>tive
reactions. Of these the positive is masked by the
predominant negative.</p>

<p>So much for theory; is it possible to unmask the
contained positive in the resulting negative response under
Direct stimulus? This important aspect of the subject
will be dealt with in the following Paper.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The application of Direct stimulus gives rise to an
electric response of gal­vano­metric negativity. The application
of stimulus at a distance from the responding point,
<i>i.e.</i>, Indirect stimulus, gives rise to positive electric response.</p>

<p>The mechanical responses of sensitive plants also exhibit
similar effects, <i>i.e.</i>, a negative response under Direct,
and positive response under Indirect stimulus.</p>

<p>In the responsive variation of growth, Direct stimulus
induces a retardation, and Indirect stimulus an ac­cel­er­ation
of the rate of growth.</p>

<p>The effects of Direct and Indirect stimulus on vegetable
organs in general are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Direct stimulus induces negative variation of turgor,
contraction, fall of leaf of <i>Mimosa</i>, electric
change of gal­vano­metric negativity, and retardation
of the rate of growth.</p>

<p>Indirect stimulus induces positive variation of turgor,
expansion, erection of leaf of <i>Mimosa</i>, electrical
change of gal­vano­metric positivity and ac­cel­er­ation
of the rate of growth.</p></div>

<h3>XVIII.&mdash;RESPONSE OF GROWING ORGANS IN STATE
OF SUB-TONICITY</h3>

<p class="tac mt1em"><i>By</i></p>

<p class="tac mtb1em"><span class="smcap">Sir J.&nbsp;C. Bose.</span></p>


<p>The normal response of a growing organ to Direct
stimulus is <i>negative</i>, that is to say, a retardation of the
rate of growth. This is the case under forms of stimuli
as diverse as those of mechanical and electric shocks, and
of the stimulus of light.</p>


<h4>ABNORMAL ACCELERATION OF GROWTH UNDER STIMULUS.</h4>

<p>After my in­ves­ti­ga­tions on the normal retarding effect
of light on growth, I was considerably surprised to find
the responses occasionally becoming <i>positive</i>, an ac­cel­er­ation
instead of retardation of growth. I shall first give accounts
of such positive responses and then explain the cause of
the abnormality.</p>

<p><i>Abnormal ac­cel­er­ation under stimulus of light: Experiment 87.</i>&mdash;A
rather weak specimen of <i>Kysoor</i> was exposed
to the action of light of 5 minutes’ duration. This induced
an abnormal ac­cel­er­ation in the rate of growth from 0.30 µ
to 0.40&nbsp;µ per second. But continuous exposure to light
for half an hour brought about the normal effect of retardation.
In trying to account for this abnormality in
response I found that while specimens of <i>Kysoor</i> in a
vigorous state of growth of about 0.8&nbsp;µ per second
exhibit normal retardation of growth under light, the<span class="pagenum" title="220"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a></span>
particular specimen which exhibited the abnormal positive
response had a much feebler rate of growth of 0.30&nbsp;µ
per second. As activity of growth in a plant is an index
of its healthy tone, a feeble rate of growth must be
indicative of tonicity below par. The fact that plants in
sub-tonic condition exhibit abnormal ac­cel­er­ation of
growth under stimulus will be seen further demonstrated
in the next experiment.</p>

<p>In the parallel phenomenon of the response of pulvinated
organs we found that under condition of sub-tonicity,
the response becomes positive and that this abnormal
positive is converted into normal negative in consequence
of repeated stimulation. In growth, response
likewise the abnormal ac­cel­er­ation of growth under light
in the sub-tonic specimen of <i>Kysoor</i> was converted into
normal retardation after continuous stimulation for half
an hour. From the facts given above, we are justified
in drawing the following conclusions:</p>

<p>(1) That while light induces a <i>retardation</i> of growth
in a tissue whose tonic condition is normal or above par,
it brings about an <i>ac­cel­er­ation</i> in a tissue whose condition
is below par.</p>

<p>(2) That by the action of the stimulus of light itself
a sub-tonic tissue is raised to a condition at par, with the
concomitant restoration of normal mode of response by
retardation of growth.</p>

<p>Another important question arises in this connection:
Is the restoration of normal response due to light as a
form of stimulus, or to its photo-synthetic action? An
answer to this is to be found from the results of an
inquiry, whether a very different form of stimulus which
exerts no photo-synthetic action, such as tetanising electric
shocks, also induces a similar ac­cel­er­ation of growth in a
sub-tonic tissue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="221"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a></span></p>

<p>The normal retarding effect of electric stimulus on
specimens in active state of growth was demonstrated
in record given in <a href="#fig72">Fig.&nbsp;72</a>, where the normal rate was
found greatly reduced after stimulation.</p>

<p><i>Abnormal ac­cel­er­ation of growth under electric stimulus:
Experiment 88.</i>&mdash;For my present purpose I took a
sub-tonic specimen of seedling of wheat, its rate of growth
being as low as 0.05&nbsp;µ per second. After electric stimulation
the rate was found enhanced to 0.12&nbsp;µ per second,
or about two and-a-half times. I give (Fig.&nbsp;82) two records
obtained with two different specimens. In the first, the
record was taken on a stationary plate (Fig.&nbsp;82). The
closeness of successive dots in N show the feeble rate
of growth of the sub-tonic specimen, the wider spacing
after stimulation, S, exhibit the induced enhancement of
growth.</p>

<p>In the second experiment the records (Fig.&nbsp;82<i>b</i>) were
taken on a moving plate. The specimen was so extremely sub-tonic,
that its normal record N appears almost horizontal.
The greater erection of the curve, S, after stimulation
demonstrates the induced ac­cel­er­ation of growth.</p>

</table></div>

<p>In my previous Paper on the ‘Modifying Influence of
Tonic Condition’ I showed that while the response of
the primary pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i> in normal condition is
<i>negative</i>, i.e., by contraction, diminution of turgor, and fall
of the leaf, the response of a sub-tonic specimen is <i>positive</i>,
that is to say, by expansion, enhancement of turgor, and
erection of the leaf. I have shown further that in a
sub-tonic specimen the action of stimulus itself raises the
tissue from below par to normal or even above par, with
the conversion of abnormal positive to normal negative
response.</p>

<p>I have in the present Paper shown that a parallel series
of reactions is seen in the response of growing organs.
In vigorously growing specimens the action of stimulus is
<i>negative</i>, i.e., incipient contraction, diminution of turgor,
and retardation of the rate of growth. But in sub-tonic
specimens, with enfeebled rate of growth, the effect of<span class="pagenum" title="223"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a></span>
stimulus is <i>positive</i>, i.e., by expansion, enhancement of
turgor, and ac­cel­er­ation of the rate of growth. Continuous
stimulation also raises the sub-tonic growing tissue to a
condition at par, converting the response from abnormal
positive to normal negative.</p>

<p>It was also explained that every stimulus gave rise to
dual reactions, positive and negative, and that in a highly
excitable tissue the positive is masked by the predominant
negative. The positive, or A-effect, is generally described
as a “building up” process. By choosing a sub-tonic
specimen, I have been able to unmask the positive, A.
In the case of sub-tonic growing organs the positive, A,
is literally a building up process, giving rise to an ac­cel­er­ation
of growth.</p>

<p>From these facts and others given previously it will
be seen that the abnormal response of ac­cel­er­ation of
growth under stimulus is by no means accidental or
fortuitous but is a definite expression of an universal
reaction, char­ac­ter­is­tic­al­ly exhibited by all tissues in a
condition of sub-tonicity.</p>


<h4>CONTINUITY BETWEEN ABNORMAL AND NORMAL
RESPONSES.</h4>

<p>A given plant-tissue may exist in widely different
conditions of tonicity. Let us take two extreme conditions,
the optimum and the minimum. The tonic level
will be at its lowest at the minimum, where growth
will be at a standstill. The range between the optimum
and minimum will be very extended; hence strong
and long continued stimulation will be necessary to raise
the tissue from the tonic minimum to the optimum
level. There are innumerable grades of tonicity between
the optimum and minimum. Within this wide range the
char­ac­ter­is­tic response will be the abnormal positive. As we
approach the optimum, the range for positive response will<span class="pagenum" title="224"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a></span>
become circumscribed, and the intensity and duration of
stimulus necessary to convert the positive to negative will
be feebler and shorter. It will be very seldom that a
plant is likely to be found at the optimum. Hence
plants in general may be expected to give a feeble positive
response under sub-minimal stimulus.</p>

<p>These considerations led me to look for the positive
response under sub-minimal stimulation; the tracings
which I have obtained with my highly sensitive Crescograph
and other recorders show that my anticipations
have been justified.</p>

exhib­its ac­cel­er­ation of growth. Last part of curve shows re­cov­ery of normal
growth on ces­sa­tion of stimu­lus.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Positive response under sub-minimal stimulus: Experiment
89.</i>&mdash;In normal specimens, light of strong intensity induces
a retardation of growth. When the source of light
is placed at a distance, the intensity of light
undergoes great diminution. Under the action of such
feeble stimulus I obtained an ac­cel­er­ation of growth even
in specimens which may be regarded as moderately vigorous
(Fig.&nbsp;83). Similar ac­cel­er­ation of growth was also<span class="pagenum" title="225"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a></span>
obtained under feeble electric stimulation. The response
is reversed to normal negative by increasing the intensity
or duration of stimulus. Very feeble stimulus thus induces
an ac­cel­er­ation and strong stimulus a retardation of
growth. I have frequently obtained positive mechanical and
electrical responses under sub-minimal stimulation. As
chemical substances often act as stimulating agents, the
opposite effects of the same drug in small and large
doses may perhaps prove to be a parallel phenomenon.</p>

<p>It has been shown that stimulus induces simultaneously
both A- and D-effects, with the attendant positive
and negative responsive reactions, alike in pulvinated and
in growing organs. A tissue, in an optimum condition, exhibits
only the resultant negative response; the comparatively
feeble positive is imperceptible, being masked by the predominant
negative; but with the decline of its tone ex­cit­abil­ity
diminishes, with it the D-effect, and we get the
A-effect unmasked, resulting response then becomes diphasic.
In extreme sub-tonic condition, it exhibits only the positive.
The sequence is reversed when we begin with a tissue in
a state of extreme sub-tonicity, which first exhibits only the
positive. Successive stimulations continually exalt the tonic
condition, the subsequent responses becoming, diphasic, and,
with the attainment of optimum tone, a resultant negative
response. As a further verification of the simultaneous
existence of both A- and D-effects, it has been shown
that in ordinary tonic condition a <i>sub-minimal</i> stimulus
gives rise only to positive response; this becomes converted
into normal negative under moderate stimulation.</p>

<p>I have described the action of stimulus on tissues in
which, on account of sub-tonicity, growth has become enfeebled.
I shall next take up the question of effect of<span class="pagenum" title="226"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a></span>
stimulus on tissues in which growth, on account of extreme
sub-tonicity, has been brought to a state of standstill.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The modifying influence of tonic condition on response
is similar in pulvinated and growing organs.</p>

<p>The motile organ of <i>Mimosa</i> in a condition of sub-tonicity,
exhibits a <i>positive</i> response, by expansion, increase of
turgor, and erection of the leaf. Continuous stimulation
converts the abnormal <i>positive</i> to normal <i>negative</i>.</p>

<p>In sub-tonic growing organs stimulus likewise induces
a <i>positive</i> response, by expansion, increase of turgor and
ac­cel­er­ation of the rate of growth. Continuous stimulation
converts the abnormal ac­cel­er­ation to normal retardation.</p>

<p>Sub-minimal stimulus tends to induce even in normal
tissues, an ac­cel­er­ation of rate of growth. Stimulus of
moderate intensity induces in the same tissue the normal
retardation of growth.</p>

<h3>XIX.&mdash;RESUMPTION OF AUTONOMOUS PULSATION
AND OF GROWTH UNDER STIMULUS</h3>

<p class="tac mt1em"><i>By</i></p>

<p class="tac mtb1em"><span class="smcap">Sir J.&nbsp;C. Bose.</span></p>


<p>The autonomous activity of growth is ultimately derived
from energy supplied by the environment. The internal
activity may fall below par with consequent diminution or
even arrest of growth; this condition of the tissue I have
designated as sub-tonic. The inert plant can only be stirred
up to a state of activity by stimulus from outside; and
we saw that under the action of stimulus the rate of
growth of a sub-tonic tissue was enhanced.</p>

<p>As the general question of depression of autonomous activity
and its restoration by the action of stimulus is of
much theoretical importance, I shall describe experiments
carried out on a different form of autonomous activity,
seen in spontaneous pulsation of the lateral leaflets of
<i>Desmodium gyrans</i>. Under favourable conditions of light
and warmth these leaflets execute vigorous movements,
the period of a single pulse varying from one to two
minutes. As the energy for this activity is ultimately
derived from the environment, it is clear that isolation
from the action of favourable environment will bring
about a gradual depletion of energy with concomitant
decline and ultimate cessation of spontaneous movement.
For this we may keep the plant in semi-darkness; we
may further hasten the rundown process by isolating the
leaflet from the parent plant. A leaflet immersed in water
was kept in a dimly lighted room; it was attached by a<span class="pagenum" title="228"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a></span>
cocoon thread to the recording lever of an Oscillating
Recorder to be fully described in the next Paper. The
pulsation continued even in this isolated condition for about
48 hours, after which the spontaneous movement came to
a stop. Further experiments showed that the arrest of
pulsation was not indicative of mortality but of ‘latent life’
in a state of suspense, to be stirred up again by shock
stimulus into throbbing activity.</p>


<h4>REVIVAL OF AUTONOMOUS PULSATION UNDER STIMULUS.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 90.</i>&mdash;In figure 84, is a seen record of the
action of light on the sub-tonic <i>Desmodium</i> leaflet at
standstill. A narrow pencil of light from electric arc
was first thrown on the lamina in which the presence of
chlorophyll rendered photo-synthetic action possible. This
had no effect on the renewal of pulsation. But the
autonomous activity was revived by the action of light on
the pulvinule. This preferential effect on pulvinule showed
that the renewal of activity was due not to photo-synthesis
but to the stimulating action of light. The pulsation
was also restored by chemical stimulants, such as
dilute ether, and solution of ammonium carbonate.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="229"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a></span></p>

<p>As regards the action of light, the pulsation continued
for a time, even on the cessation of light. This persistence
of autonomous activity increases with the intensity
and duration of incident stimulus, that is to say with
the amount of incident energy. In the present case
a duration of five minutes’ exposure gave rise to a
single pulsation, after which the movement of the leaflet
came to a stop. The next application lasted for ten
minutes and this gave rise to four pulsations, two during
application, and two after cessation of light. The next
application was for forty-five minutes, and the pulsation
persisted for nearly an hour after the cessation of light.
The experiments on sub-tonic specimens show clearly that
the energy supplied by the environment becomes as it
were latent in the plant, increasing its potentiality for
work.</p>

<p>The renewal of autonomous activity in a sub-tonic
tissue by the action of external stimulus, will be found in
every way parallel to the renewal of growth in a sub-tonic
organ.</p>


<h4>REVIVAL OF GROWTH UNDER STIMULUS.</h4>

down­wards.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Renewal of growth under stimulus: Experiment 91.</i>&mdash;I
find that application of electric stimulus renews growth
in specimens where, on account of extreme sub-tonicity
growth has come to a state of standstill. The resumption
of growth in grass haulms under the stimulus of gravity
is a phenomenon probably connected with the above. The
causes which bring about cessation of growth in a mature
organ are unknown; that there is a potentiality of growth
even in a fully grown grass haulm is evidenced by the
fact of its renewed growth under fresh stimulation. That
this is not an exceptional phenomenon appears from the
record which I obtained with a fully grown style of<span class="pagenum" title="230"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a></span>
<i>Datura alba</i>. I subjected it to periodic stimulation, and
obtained from it a series of contractile responses. After
recovery from stimulus it regained its normal length which
remained constant for some time as seen in the horizontal
base-line. But as a result of successive stimulations, the
mature style resumed its growth with increasing ac­cel­er­ation.
This is seen in the recovery overshooting its former horizontal
limit (Fig.&nbsp;85).</p>

<p>From the in­ves­ti­ga­tions that have been described in
this and in the previous Papers an insight is obtained into
the complexity of response arising from various factors.
It has been shown that the sign of response is modified by
the intensity of stimulus, by its point of application, and
by the tonic condition of the responding tissue. The fundamental
reactions have been found to be essentially the same
in pulvinated, in growing and non-growing organs. The<span class="pagenum" title="231"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a></span>
results described enable us to enunciate general Laws of
Effects of Direct and Indirect stimulus on tissues in normal
and in sub-tonic condition.</p>


<h4>LAWS OF EFFECTS OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT STIMULUS.</h4>

<div class="fs80">
<p>1. THE EFFECT OF DIRECT STIMULUS IS NEGATIVE

RESPONSE, NEGATIVE VARIATION, OR RETARDATION

<p>2. THE EFFECT OF INDIRECT STIMULUS IS POSITIVE
VARIATION OF TURGOR, POSITIVE MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL
RESPONSE AND POSITIVE VARIATION OR ACCELERATION
OF RATE OF GROWTH.</p></div>

<p>I have referred to the fact previously demonstrated, that
while Direct stimulus induces contraction and retardation
of growth, moderate rise of temperature induces the
opposite effect of expansion and ac­cel­er­ation of growth.
Further demonstration of the antagonistic effects of stimulus
and warmth will be given in the next Paper.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The autonomous activity of pulsating leaflet of <i>Desmodium
gyrans</i> comes to a stop under depletion of internal
energy. A cut leaf isolated from the plant maintains the<span class="pagenum" title="232"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a></span>
rhythmic activity of its leaflets for about 48 hours, after
which there is an arrest of movement.</p>

<p>In this state of sub-tonicity the arrested autonomous
activity is revived under the action of various stimuli.
Thus the incidence of light on the pulvinule initiates pulsatory
movements, which persists for a time even on the
cessation of stimulus. This persistence of autonomous activity
increases with the intensity and duration of stimulus
to which the leaflet had been subjected.</p>

<p>The arrested autonomous activity of growth may often
be revived by the action of stimulus. Thus the arrested
growth in a mature style or <i>Datura alba</i> was renewed by
electric stimulation.</p>

<h3>XX.&mdash;ACTION OF LIGHT AND WARMTH ON
AUTONOMOUS ACTIVITY</h3>

<p class="tac mt1em"><i>By</i></p>

<p class="tac mtb1em"><span class="smcap">Sir J.&nbsp;C. Bose.</span></p>


<p>In the preceding Paper I have shown the essential similarity
of effect of stimulus on autonomous activity of the
<i>Desmodium</i> leaflet, and of the growing organ. It was shown
how stimulus revived the pulsatory activity of <i>Desmodium</i>
leaflet in a state of standstill, in the same way as it renewed
the arrested growth-activity.</p>


<h4>THE OSCILLATING RECORDER.</h4>

<p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tion of this subject was rendered possible
by the successful device of my Oscillating Recorder. A very
light glass fibre was used for the construction of the lever,
which was supported on jewel bearings. The short arm of
the lever was 2&nbsp;cm. in length, and the long arm 8&nbsp;cm.
This gave a mag­ni­fi­ca­tion of 4 times. But it is quite easy
to increase the mag­ni­fi­ca­tion to 10 times or more.</p>

<p>The pull exerted by the pulsating leaflet is extremely
slight, and the relatively heavy lever made of steel wire
used in the Resonant Recorder is not well-suited for our
purpose. The pulsation of the leaflet is relatively slow,
being once in two minutes or so. The intermittent contact
of ten times in a second, given by the Resonant Recorder,
is therefore too quick. In the Oscillating Recorder the intermittence
was, therefore, reduced to once in a second, or
once in five seconds, the recording plate itself being made to
move to-and-fro at this rate. The carrier of the plate-holder
slides backwards and forwards on ball bearings; a<span class="pagenum" title="234"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a></span>
wheel in the clockwork connected with an eccentric is
released periodically, at intervals which may be varied
between one and five seconds. By the action of the eccentric,
the plate carrier approaches the writing lever with
diminish­ing speed till the movement is zero at the contact.
This contrivance is essential, since any sudden shock of
the plate against the lever is apt to give rise to after-vibrations
of the writer. The plate carrier is quickly withdrawn
after the production of a dot on the smoked glass
plate by contact with the writing lever.</p>

<p>The clockwork is governed by a revolving fan which
can be gradually opened out by a regulating screw. The
speed can thus be adjusted within wide limits, and maintained
constant and at any desired speed. A second set of
wheels connected with the clockwork moves the plate-holder
in a lateral direction. A series of records may thus be
taken for fifteen minutes, half an hour, or an hour.</p>

<p>The record obtained in this way is very perfect. Not
only is the effect of an external agent shown by variation
in the amplitude and frequency of pulsations, but the
change of speed in any phase of the pulse becomes automatically
recorded.</p>


<h4>RECORD OF PULSATION OF <i>DESMODIUM GYRANS</i>.</h4>

<p>The whole plant can not be conveniently manipulated
for different in­ves­ti­ga­tions. It is, however, possible using
the precautions described below to use the detached petiole
carrying the pulsating leaflets. The terminal large leaf may
also be removed. The necessary amputation is often followed
by an arrest of pulsation. But as in the case of isolated
heart in a state of standstill, the movement of the leaflet
may be revived by the application of internal hydrostatic
pressure. Under these conditions, the rhythmic pulsations
may easily be maintained uniform for many hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="235"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a></span></p>

<p>The petiole carrying the leaflet is mounted water-tight
in the short arm of an U-tube filled with water; for producing
internal hydrostatic pressure in the plant the height
of water in the longer arm is suitably raised. The U-tube
holding the specimen may be adjusted up and down, and
laterally. A hinged support also allows the specimen to be
placed at any inclination. The movement of the leaflet, it
is to be remembered, does not always take place in a
vertical direction. The object of the mechanical adjustments
is to place the specimen at such an angle that its up and
down movements when in a straight line should be vertical,
or have its long axis vertical when the movement is
elliptical. It is important that the specimen should be
illuminated equally from all sides; for one-sided illumination
causes a bending over of the leaflet towards light.</p>

<p>The pulvinule of the leaflet acts like the pulvinus of
<i>Mimosa</i>, that is to say, the leaflet undergoes a sudden fall
to down position by the contraction of the more effective
lower half of the pulvinule; the ‘up’ position denotes recovery
and expansion of the more effective half. The
up-and-down movements of the leaflet correspond to the
diastolic and systolic movements of the animal heart.
There is, indeed, as I have shown <span class="nowrap">elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_W_23" id="FNanchor_W_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a></span> a very
close resemblance between the activities of rhythmic tissue
in the plant and in the animal.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF DIFFUSE LIGHT ON PULSATION OF
<i>DESMODIUM</i>.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 92.</i>&mdash;For the study of effect of light on <i>Desmodium</i>,
I first obtained record in darkness. A horizontal
beam of divergent light from an arc lamp placed at a distance
of 200&nbsp;cm. was made to act diffusely on the leaf from
all sides. This was done by means of three inclined mirrors,
the first throwing the light vertically downwards, the<span class="pagenum" title="236"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a></span>
second vertically upwards, and the third horizontally forward
from the side opposite the lantern. The effect of
light is seen demonstrated in Fig.&nbsp;86.</p>

</div>

<p>Light was applied at the second pulsation. It will be
seen that light retards or arrests the autonomous activity.
On the cessation of light the normal activity was found
to be gradually restored. It is of much interest to note
here the similarity of action of light on autonomous activity
of the leaflet of <i>Desmodium</i> and of a growing organ.
In both, we find that while in the sub-tonic condition
of the tissue the effect of light is to enhance or renew
the autonomous activity of growth and pulsation, in normal
condition the effect is to retard it.</p>

<p>Inspection of the record exhibits another very interesting
char­ac­ter­is­tic. We saw that light retarded growth by
inducing an incipient contraction. In the <i>Desmodium</i>
leaflet the contractile reaction of light is exhibited by the
char­ac­ter­is­tic modi­fi­ca­tion of its pulsations. The duration<span class="pagenum" title="237"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a></span>
of application of light is represented by the horizontal
line. In Fig.&nbsp;86 the up-curve represents up-movement
of diastolic expansion, and the down-curve of systolic contraction.
The contractile reaction of light is seen to
counteract the normal expansion, with diminution of diastolic
limit of pulsation.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF RISE OF TEMPERATURE ON PULSATION.</h4>

<p>It has been shown that while rise of temperature up to
an optimum enhanced the rate of growth, the effect of
light was to retard it. Hence the effects of light and
warmth are antagonistic.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Effect of rise of temperature on pulse-record: Experiment
93.</i>&mdash;In studying the effect of rise of temperature on
the pulsation of leaflets of <i>Desmodium</i>, we discover similar
antagonistic reactions of light and warmth. The leaflet
was placed in a plant-chamber with an electric arrangement
for gradual rise of temperature. The first two<span class="pagenum" title="238"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a></span>
records were taken in the normal temperature of the
room, which was 30°C. The temperature was gradually
raised to 35°C, the record being taken all the time. It
will be seen (<ins title="Transcriber’s note: No trace of the recording could be seen in this figure.">Fig.&nbsp;87</ins>) that the effect of warmth is diametrically
opposite to that of light. The record in
<a href="#fig86">Fig.&nbsp;86</a> exhibited <i>the contractile</i> effect of light by reducing
the diastolic limit of expansion. In the present
case the <i>expansive</i> reaction of warmth is exhibited by the
reduction of systolic limit of contraction. The temperature
of the plant chamber was now allowed to return to 30°C.,
and we observe the gradual restoration of normal systolic
limit of contraction.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>Two different effects are found in the action of the
stimulus of light alike on the autonomous activity of
leaflet of <i>Desmodium gyrans</i> and of growing organs. In
condition of sub-tonicity light renews pulsation of <i>Desmodium</i>
and enhances the activity of growth. In normal
tonic condition the effect induced is the very opposite,
light causing an arrest of pulsation and retardation or
arrest of growth.</p>

<p>The contractile effect of light is seen not only in the
retardation of growth, but also by the char­ac­ter­is­tic modi­fi­ca­tion
of pulsation of <i>Desmodium</i> in the diminution of
diastolic limit of expansion.</p>

<p>The antagonistic reactions of light and warmth are
found not only in growth but also in the rhythmic
activity of <i>Desmodium gyrans</i>. In the pulsation of <i>Desmodium</i>
the contractile effect of light induces a rapid
diminution of the diastolic limit of expansion, while the
expansive reaction of warmth brings about a marked
reduction of the systolic limit in successive pulsations.</p>

<h3>XXI.&mdash;A COMPARISON OF RESPONSES IN GROWING
AND NON-GROWING ORGANS</h3>

<p>I have in the preceding series of Papers demonstrated
the effects of various forms of stimuli on growth. I have
also given accounts of numerous reactions which are
extraordinarily similar, in growing and non-growing organs.
In fact certain char­ac­ter­is­tic reactions observed in motile
pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i> and other ‘sensitive’ plants led to the
discovery of the corresponding phenomena in growing
organs. For fully realising the essential similarity of
responses given by all plant-organs, growing and non-growing,
I shall give here a short review of the striking
character of the parallelism.</p>

<p>1. The incipient contraction of a growing organ under
stimulus culminates in a marked shortening of the organ.</p>

<p>2. The similarity of contractile responses in growing
and pulvinated organs.</p>

<p>3. Similar modi­fi­ca­tion of both under condition of
sub-tonicity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="240"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a></span></p>

<p>4. The opposite effects of Direct and Indirect stimulus,
both in motile and in growing organs.</p>

<p>5. The exhibition by all plant-organs of <i>negative</i> electric
response under Direct, and <i>positive</i> electric response
under Indirect stimulus.</p>

<p>6. Similar modi­fi­ca­tion of autonomous activity in
<i>Desmodium gyrans</i> and in growing organs under parallel
conditions.</p>

<p>7. Similar excitatory effects of various stimuli on pulvinated
and growing organs.</p>

<p>8. Similar discriminative effects of different rays of
light in excitation of motile and growing organs.</p>


<h4>CONTRACTILE RESPONSE OF GROWING AND NON-GROWING
ORGANS.</h4>

<p>I have shown (<a href="#Page_198">page 198</a>) that a growing organ under
stimulus, undergoes an incipient contraction as shown in
the responsive retardation of its rate of growth; that this
retardation increases with the intensity of the incident stimulus
till growth becomes arrested. Above this critical
intensity the induced contraction causes an actual shortening
of the organ. There is no breach of continuity in the increasing
contractile reaction, which at various stages appears
as a retardation, an arrest of growth or a marked shortening
of length of the organ.</p>


<h4>CONTRACTILE RESPONSE OF PULVINATED AND GROWING
ORGANS.</h4>

</div>

<p><i>Experiment 94.</i>&mdash;In order to show the striking similarity
between the response of ‘sensitive’ <i>Mimosa</i> and that of a<span class="pagenum" title="241"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a></span>
growing organ, I give a record (Fig.&nbsp;88) obtained with a
growing bud of <i>Crinum</i> under the stimulus of electric shock
above the critical intensity. The recorder gave a mag­ni­fi­ca­tion
of a thousand times. In Fig.&nbsp;88, the normal growth
elongation is represented as a down-curve. On the application
of stimulus the normal expansion was suddenly reversed
to excitatory contraction, the latent period of reaction was
one second and the period of the attainment of maximum
contraction (apex-time) was 4 minutes. The organ recovered
its original length after a further period of seven
minutes and then continued its natural growth elongation.
Repetition of stimuli gave rise to successive contractile
responses which are in every way similar to the mechanical
responses of <i>Mimosa pudica</i>. The essential similarity of<span class="pagenum" title="242"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a></span>
response of pulvinated and growing organs will be seen in
the following tabular statement:</p>

</table></div>

<p>The contraction in growing organs under stimulus is
sometimes considerable. Thus in the filamentous corona of
<i>Passiflora quadrangularis</i> the contraction may be as much
as 15 per cent. of the original length. This is not very
different from the excitatory reaction of the typically sensitive
stamens of the <i>Cynereæ</i>, which exhibits a contraction
from 8 to 22 per cent.</p>


<h4>MODIFICATION OF RESPONSE BY CONDITION OF SUB-TONICITY.</h4>

<p>In <i>Mimosa</i> the normal response to direct stimulus is
<i>negative</i>, the leaf undergoing a fall. But sub-tonic specimens
exhibit a <i>positive</i> response with erection of the leaf.
The action of the stimulus itself improves the tonic condition,
and the abnormal positive is thus converted into
normal negative, through diphasic response (<a href="#Page_147">p.&nbsp;147</a>). Similarly
in growing organs, while the normal effect of stimulus
is incipient contraction and retardation of growth
under condition of sub-tonicity the response is by ac­cel­er­ation
of growth. Continuous stimulation converts this<span class="pagenum" title="243"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a></span>
abnormal ac­cel­er­ation into normal retardation of growth
(<a href="#Page_225">p.&nbsp;225</a>).</p>


<h4>EFFECTS OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT STIMULUS.</h4>

<p>Direct stimulus induces in <i>Mimosa</i> and other ‘sensitive’
plants a <i>negative</i> response. There is a diminution of
turgor and contraction in the motile organ, resulting in the
fall of leaf. Indirect stimulus, on the other hand, gives
rise to a <i>positive</i> or erectile response, indicative of increase
of turgor and expansion (<a href="#Page_138">p.&nbsp;138</a>).</p>

<p>In growing organs Direct stimulus induces an incipient
contraction and retardation of rate of growth; the effect of
Indirect stimulus is expansion and ac­cel­er­ation of the rate
of growth (<a href="#Page_216">p.&nbsp;216</a>).</p>

<p>The opposite reactions to Direct and Indirect stimulus
are also found in the electric response given by all plant
organs. Thus while Direct stimulus induces an electromotive
change of gal­vano­metric negativity, Indirect stimulus
induces the opposite change of gal­vano­metric positivity
(<a href="#Page_214">p.&nbsp;214</a>).</p>


<h4>MODIFICATION OF AUTONOMOUS ACTIVITY.</h4>

<p>The autonomous activity of <i>Desmodium gyrans</i> exhibited
by the pulsation of its leaflets come to a stop under
condition of sub-tonicity. The arrested movement is, however,
revived by the action of stimulus (<a href="#Page_228">p.&nbsp;228</a>). The
depressed or arrested growth of a growing organ is similarly
accelerated or revived by the action of stimulus
(<a href="#Page_230">p.&nbsp;230</a>).</p>

<p>In vigorous specimens stimulus induces the opposite effect
by retarding or arresting the pulsatory activity or growth.</p>

<p>Warmth induces an effect which is antagonistic to that
of stimulus. The contractile effect of stimulus is seen in
the pulsations of leaflet <i>Desmodium</i> by the reduction of
their expansive or diastolic limit, and in growing organs
by the retardation of the rate of growth. The expansive
effect of warmth is seen in reduction of the systolic limit<span class="pagenum" title="244"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a></span>
of <i>Desmodium</i> pulsation, and in the ac­cel­er­ation of rate
of growth in growing organs (<a href="#Page_237">p.&nbsp;237</a>).</p>


<h4>EXCITATORY EFFECTS OF VARIOUS STIMULI ON
PULVINATED AND GROWING ORGANS.</h4>

<p>Certain agents induce excitation in living tissues, the
excitatory change being detected by contraction, or by
electromotive variation, or by change of electric resistance,
and in growing organs by the retardation of the rate of
growth. In general, the various stimuli which excite animal
tissues also excite vegetable tissues.</p>

<p>It has been shown that <i>every form of stimuli, however
diverse, also induces incipient contraction and retardation
of the rate of growth</i>. Thus mechanical irritation, such
as friction or wound, induces a retardation of growth
(<a href="#Page_202">p.&nbsp;202</a>); they also induce an excitatory contraction in
<i>Mimosa</i>, attended by the fall of the leaf. Different modes
of electric stimulation act similarly on both growing
and pulvinated organs. The action of light visible and invisible
will presently be seen to react on both alike. And
in this connection nothing could be more significant than
the discriminative manner in which both the pulvinated
and the growing organs respond to certain lights and not
to others.</p>

<p>In contrast to the contractile effect of stimulus, certain
agents induce the antagonistic reaction of expansion. It
has been shown that while stimulus induces a retardation,
rise of temperature up to an optimum point, induces an
ac­cel­er­ation of the rate of growth. I have also referred to
the fact that while the autonomous pulsations of <i>Desmodium</i>
leaflet exhibit under stimulus a diminution of the extent
of the diastolic expansion, warmth on the other hand, induces
the opposite effect by diminish­ing the systolic contraction.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF LIGHT ON PULVINATED ORGANS.</h4>

<p>I have referred to the well-known fact that it is the
more refrangible portions of the spectrum that are more effective
in inducing excitatory reactions and have already given<span class="pagenum" title="245"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a></span>
records of the responsive reactions of various lights on
growing organs. I shall now give records of the effect of
various lights on the pulvinus of <i>Mimosa pudica</i>. The
amplitude and time relations of the curves of response will
give a more precise idea of the quantitative effects of
various lights in inducing excitation.</p>

in this and in the follow­ing records are at inter­vals of 10″. (Magnification 100
times)</div>
</div>

<p><i>Action of white light: Experiment 95.</i>&mdash;The source of
light was an arc lamp; a pencil of parallel light is
made to pass through a trough of alum solution. This
process of excluding thermal rays is adopted for the visible
rays of the spectrum. Colour filters were also used for
obtaining red, yellow and blue lights. The pencil of light
is thrown upwards by an inclined mirror on the lower
half of the pulvinus. The response is taken by an Oscillating
recorder, giving successive dots at intervals of 10
seconds, the mag­ni­fi­ca­tion employed being 100 times. The
pulvinus being subjected to light for 10 seconds gave
response by a fall of the leaf (Fig.&nbsp;89). The response to light
is thus found to be essentially similar to that induced by
electric stimulus, the only difference being in the relative
sluggishness of the reply. Electric shock passes instantaneously
through the mass of the pulvinus, stirring up<span class="pagenum" title="246"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a></span>
the active tissues to responsive contraction. The latent
period is, therefore, as short as 0.1 second and the maximum
contraction is effected in about 3 seconds. In the
case of the stimulus of light the shock-effect is not so
great; excitation, moreover, has to pass slowly from the
surface of the pulvinus inwards. Hence the latent period
is twelve seconds, and the period of maximum contraction
is as long as 90 seconds. As the stimulation is
moderate, the recovery is effected in 11 minutes,
instead of 16 minutes, which is the usual period for
<i>Mimosa</i> to recover from an electric shock. The important
conclusion to be derived from this experiment is, that light
is a mode of stimulation and that it induces a responsive
contraction, similar to that caused by other forms of stimuli.
This contractile response under light is exhibited
not merely by the motile pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i>, but by
other pulvini as well, such as those of <i>Erythrina indica</i>,
and of the ordinary bean plant.</p>

<p><i>Action of red and yellow lights.</i>&mdash;The pulvinus gave
little or practically no response to these lights.</p>

<p><i>Action of blue light: Experiment 96.</i>&mdash;Light was applied
for 10 seconds and the amplitude of response was similar
to that induced by white light (Fig.&nbsp;90).</p>

<p><i>Action of Ultra-violet rays: Experiment 97.</i>&mdash;The source
of light was a quartz mercury-vapour lamp. The effect was
so intense that, to keep the record within the plate, I
had to reduce the period of exposure to half, <i>i.e.</i>, to five
seconds. The responsive movement was initiated within six
seconds of the application of light. The intensity and the
rapidity of reaction is independently evidenced by the more
erect curve of response (Fig.&nbsp;91).</p>

</div>

<p><i>Action of Infra-red rays: Experiment 98.</i>&mdash;The obscure
thermal rays also caused a strong excitatory reaction
(Fig.&nbsp;92). Attention is here drawn once more to the
antagonistic reactions of temperature and radiation effects
of heat.</p>

<p>It has been shown that the rays which cause the
most intense excitations in <i>Mimosa</i> also induce the greatest
retardation in the rate of growth. Thus ultra-violet is
not only the most effective in causing excitation in <i>Mimosa</i>
but also in retardation of growth. Next in order comes
the blue rays: the yellow and red are practically ineffective

effective in exciting the sensitive <i>Mimosa</i> and in retarding
the rate of growth.</p>

<h4>DIVERSE MODES OF RESPONSE TO STIMULUS.</h4>

<p>In <i>Mimosa</i> excitation is followed by the striking manifestation
of the fall of the leaf. But in rigid trees contraction
under excitation cannot find expression in movements.
I have shown elsewhere that even in the absence
of realised movement, the state of excitation can be detected
by the induced electromotive change. I have shown
that not only every plant but every organ of every plant is
sensitive and reacts to stimulus by electric response of
gal­vano­metric negativity<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_X_24" id="FNanchor_X_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a></span></p>

<p>There is an additional electric method by which the
excitatory change may be recorded. I find that excitation
induces a variation of the electrical resistance of a
vegetable tissue<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_Y_25" id="FNanchor_Y_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_25" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a></span> Thus the same excitatory reaction finds<span class="pagenum" title="249"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a></span>
diverse concomitant manifestations, in diminution of turgor,
in movement, in variation of growth, and in electrical
change. The correspondence in the different phases of
response in pulvinated, ordinary, and growing organs
may be stated as follows: Excitation induces diminution
of turgor, contraction and fall of the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i>; it
induces an incipient contraction or retardation of rate of
growth in a growing organ; it gives rise in all plant
organs to an electric response of gal­vano­metric negativity
and of changed resistance. All these excitatory manifestations
will, for convenience, be designated as the
<i>negative</i> response. There is a responsive reaction which
is opposite to the excitatory change described above. In
<i>Mimosa</i> the fall of leaf under excitation is due to a
sudden diminution of turgor; the erection of the leaf is
brought about by natural or artificial restoration of turgor.
Rise of temperature induces an expansive reaction which
is antagonistic to that induced by stimulus. Warmth also
enhances the rate of growth and induces an electric change
of gal­vano­metric positivity<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_Z_26" id="FNanchor_Z_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_26" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a></span> The restoration of normal
turgor or enhancement of turgor is associated with expansion,
erection of the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i>, enhancement of rate of
growth in a growing organ, electric response of gal­vano­metric
positivity, and contrasted change of electric resistance.
All these will be distinguished as <i>positive</i> response.</p>

<p>There are thus several independent means of detecting
the excitatory change or its opposite reaction in vegetable
tissues. It will be seen that the employment of these
different methods has greatly extended our power of in­ves­ti­ga­tion
on the phenomenon of irritability of plants.</p>

<p>We have seen how essentially similar are the responsive
reactions in pulvinated and in growing organs. It is
therefore rational to seek for an explanation of a parti<span class="pagenum" title="250"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a></span>cular
movement in a growing organ from ascertained facts
relating to the corresponding movement in a pulvinated
organ. The in­ves­ti­ga­tions on motile and growing organs
that have been described fully establish the two important
facts that, Direct stimulus induces contraction and Indirect
stimulus induces the opposite expansive reaction. These facts
will be found to offer full explanation of various tropic
curvatures to be described in the subsequent series of Papers.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>There is no breach of continuity in the increasing
contractile reaction in a growing organ under increasing
intensity of stimulus; the incipient contraction seen in
retardation of rate of growth culminates in a marked
shortening of the length of the organ.</p>

<p>Time relations of response, the latent period, the apex
time, and the period of recovery are of similar order in
pulvinated and in growing organs.</p>

<p>In condition of sub-tonicity the pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i>
responds to stimulus by an abnormal <i>positive</i> or erectile
response. Under continued stimulation the abnormal positive
is converted into normal <i>negative</i>. Growing organs in sub-tonic
condition responds to stimulus by abnormal ac­cel­er­ation
of rate of growth, which is converted into normal
retardation under continuous stimulation.</p>

<p>Direct stimulus induces in <i>Mimosa</i> a <i>negative</i> response,
with the fall of leaf. But Indirect stimulus induces the
<i>positive</i> or erectile response. Similarly, Direct stimulus
induces in a growing organ a <i>negative</i> variation, or retardation
of rate of growth, and Indirect stimulus a <i>positive</i>
variation or ac­cel­er­ation of rate of growth.</p>

<p>The electric response to Direct stimulus is by gal­vano­metric
<i>negativity</i>, that to Indirect stimulus by gal­vano­metric
<i>positivity</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="251"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a></span></p>

<p>Under condition of sub-tonicity the autonomous activity
of leaflet of <i>Desmodium gyrans</i> and of growing organs
comes to a stop. The arrested activity in both is revived
by the application of stimulus. Active pulsation in <i>Desmodium</i>,
and active growth in growing organs are, however,
retarded or arrested by stimulus.</p>

<p>The contractile effect of stimulus on pulsation of leaflets
of <i>Desmodium gyrans</i> is seen by the reduction of the
diastolic limit of its pulsations; to this corresponds the
incipient contraction and retardation of rate of growth in
a growing organ. The effect of warmth is antagonistic to
that of stimulus. The expansive effect of rise of temperature
is seen in <i>Desmodium</i> by the reduction of the systolic
limit of its pulsation; in growth it is exhibited by an
ac­cel­er­ation of the rate of growth.</p>

<p>All stimuli which induce an excitatory contraction and
fall of the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i> also induce incipient contraction
and retardation of rate of growth in a growing
organ.</p>

<p>Excitatory effects of different rays of light on motile
and growing organs are similarly discriminative. Ultra-violet
light exerts the most intense reaction which reaches
a minimum towards the less refrangible red end of the
spectrum. Beyond this, the infra-red or thermal rays
become suddenly effective in inducing excitatory movement
and retardation of growth.</p>

of the cell decreases we naturally assume this to be due to a decreasing
<i>osmotic pressure</i> due to alterations in the permeability of the plasma, and an
excretion of materials from the cell. It is a remarkable fact that plasmolytic
research (Hilburg 1881) affords no evidence of any decrease in osmotic pressure.
No complete insight into the mechanism of the stimulus movement in <i>Mimosa</i>
has yet been obtained, although one thing is certain, that there is a decrease
in the expansive power on the under side of the articulation.”&mdash;Jost, “Plant
Physiology”&mdash;English Translation, p.&nbsp;515. Clarendon Press (1907). Blackman and
Paine think that the loss of turgor on excitation “is probably due to the disappearance
or inactivation of a considerable portion of the osmotic substances of
the cells.”&mdash;Annals of Botany, Vol. XXXII, No. CXXXV, Jan. 1918.</p></div>
